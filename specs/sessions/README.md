# openjd-sessions Crate Specifications

Design specifications for the `openjd-sessions` crate — the Rust runtime for executing
Open Job Description sessions (environment enter/exit, task execution, subprocess
management, and action monitoring).

This crate was inspired by the Python reference implementation
([openjd-sessions-for-python](https://github.com/OpenJobDescription/openjd-sessions-for-python))
but redesigned around Rust's async ecosystem (tokio) and ownership model. The Python
library uses threads, queues, and locks for non-blocking execution; the Rust crate
replaces all of that with async/await, channels, and cancellation tokens.

## How the Worker Agent Uses Sessions

The primary consumer is the Deadline Cloud worker agent. Understanding its usage patterns
drove the API design:

1. Agent creates a `Session` with `SessionConfig` (session_id, job parameters, path mapping
   rules, user, callback, os_env_vars, session_root_directory, revision_extensions).
2. The callback fires on every action start, `openjd_*` directive, and action completion —
   the agent forwards these to the Deadline service as real-time progress updates.
3. Actions (`enter_environment`, `exit_environment`, `run_task`) are async — the agent
   awaits them or can cancel via `cancel_action()`.
4. During cleanup, environments are exited in reverse order, then `session.cleanup()`
   deletes the working directory.

## Relationship to the Python Library

The Rust crate mirrors the Python library's public API surface but diverges significantly
in implementation. See [architecture.md § Python-vs-Rust Design Comparison](architecture.md#python-vs-rust-design-comparison)
for the full comparison table.
