# Async Subprocess Execution

## Overview

`subprocess.rs` implements async subprocess execution via `tokio::process::Command`. It
spawns a child process, streams stdout/stderr through the `ActionFilter` in real time,
sends parsed `ActionMessage` values through an mpsc channel, and handles cancelation,
timeout, and cross-user execution.

This document covers the internal `run_subprocess` function used by script runners. For
the public `Session::run_subprocess` method (ad-hoc subprocess execution for the worker
agent), see [session.md § Ad-hoc Subprocess](session.md#ad-hoc-subprocess).

## SubprocessConfig

```rust
pub struct SubprocessConfig {
    pub args: Vec<String>,              // Command + arguments
    pub env_vars: HashMap<String, Option<String>>, // Full environment variable map (None = unset)
    pub working_dir: Option<PathBuf>,   // Working directory for the subprocess
    pub timeout: Option<Duration>,      // Action timeout (None = no timeout)
    pub user: Option<Arc<dyn SessionUser>>, // Cross-user execution target
    pub cancel_method: CancelMethod,    // Terminate vs NotifyThenTerminate
    pub cancel_request_rx: Option<tokio::sync::watch::Receiver<Option<Duration>>>,
    /// Whether to accumulate stdout into `SubprocessResult.stdout`.
    /// Intended for debugging only.
    pub debug_collect_stdout: bool,
}
```

## run_subprocess

```rust
pub async fn run_subprocess(
    config: SubprocessConfig,
    filter: &mut ActionFilter,
    session_id: &str,
    message_tx: mpsc::UnboundedSender<ActionMessage>,
    cancel_token: CancellationToken,
) -> Result<SubprocessResult, SessionError>
```

### Why it takes `message_tx` instead of a callback

The Python library passes a callback that fires on each directive. This works in Python
because the callback can close over mutable session state (GIL protects concurrent access).

In Rust, a callback that mutates `Session` would require `Arc<Mutex<Session>>` or similar
interior mutability. Instead, the subprocess sends `ActionMessage` values through an mpsc
channel, and the `Session::drive_action()` method receives them with `&mut self`. This
avoids shared mutable state entirely.

### Process Group Isolation

On POSIX, the subprocess is placed in its own process group via `setsid` in a `pre_exec`
hook:

```rust
unsafe {
    command.pre_exec(|| {
        nix::unistd::setsid().map_err(|e| std::io::Error::new(...))?;
        Ok(())
    });
}
```

This mirrors Python's `start_new_session=True` and ensures that signals sent to the
process group don't propagate to the parent (the session runtime). It also enables
killing the entire process tree via `killpg`.

For cross-user execution, `setsid` is not set in `pre_exec` because sudo's child creates
its own process group. The `setsid -w` flag in the sudo command handles this instead.

### Stderr Handling

Stderr is merged into stdout processing via `dup2` in a `pre_exec` hook:

```rust
unsafe {
    command.pre_exec(|| {
        nix::unistd::dup2(1, 2)?; // stderr → stdout
        Ok(())
    });
}
```

This matches the Python library's behavior and ensures all output flows through the
`ActionFilter` for directive parsing. A separate stderr pipe would require coordinating
two streams and deciding which gets priority — merging avoids this complexity.

### Stdout Streaming Loop

```rust
let stdout = child.stdout.take().unwrap();
let mut reader = BufReader::new(stdout);
let mut line_buf = Vec::new();

loop {
    tokio::select! {
        biased;

        // Cancelation has highest priority
        _ = cancel_token.cancelled() => { /* send SIGTERM/SIGKILL */ }

        // Timeout has second priority (continues draining, does not break)
        _ = &mut timeout_sleep => { /* send SIGKILL, continue reading until EOF */ }

        // Stdout processing — reads raw bytes, lossy UTF-8 decoding
        n = reader.read_until(b'\n', &mut line_buf) => {
            match n {
                Ok(0) => break, // EOF
                Ok(_) => {
                    if line_buf.last() == Some(&b'\n') { line_buf.pop(); }
                    let line = String::from_utf8_lossy(&line_buf);
                    let line = truncate_line(&line).to_string();
                    line_buf.clear();
                    let (callbacks, pass_through, modified) = filter.filter_message(&line, session_id);
                    for cb in callbacks {
                        let msg = map_callback_to_message(cb);
                        let _ = message_tx.send(msg);
                    }
                    if pass_through {
                        session_log!(info, session_id, LogContent::COMMAND_OUTPUT, "{}", modified);
                    }
                }
                Err(_) => break,
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Why `biased` in select!

The `tokio::select!` macro is `biased`, meaning branches are checked in order rather than
randomly. This ensures:

1. Cancel requests are processed immediately, even if stdout has buffered data
2. Timeouts fire promptly, not delayed by a burst of stdout lines
3. Stdout is processed only when no higher-priority event is pending

Without `biased`, a flood of stdout could starve cancel/timeout handling due to tokio's
random branch selection.

### 64KB Line Length Limit

Lines longer than 64KB are truncated. This prevents a misbehaving subprocess from
consuming unbounded memory. The Python library has the same limit.

### 5-Second Process Exit Grace Time

After the stdout loop ends (EOF), the subprocess waits up to 5 seconds for the child
process to exit via `child.wait()`. If the process hasn't exited within 5 seconds, it
is forcefully killed:

```rust
match tokio::time::timeout(Duration::from_secs(5), child.wait()).await {
    Ok(Ok(status)) => { /* normal exit */ }
    Ok(Err(_)) => { /* wait error, send SIGKILL */ }
    Err(_) => { /* timeout, send SIGKILL */ }
}
```

This prevents the session from hanging indefinitely on processes that ignore signals
or are stuck in uninterruptible I/O.

### Why 5 seconds

The 5-second grace period balances two concerns: (1) giving the process enough time to
flush buffers and exit cleanly after stdout closes, and (2) not blocking the session
for an unreasonable time if the process is stuck. Most well-behaved processes exit
within milliseconds of stdout closing. The 5-second limit catches processes that are
stuck in uninterruptible I/O or have leaked file descriptors keeping stdout open.
The Python library uses the same timeout.

## Signal Delivery

### Same-user

| Signal | Method | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| SIGTERM | `nix::sys::signal::killpg(pgid, SIGTERM)` | Notify (graceful shutdown) |
| SIGKILL | `nix::sys::signal::killpg(pgid, SIGKILL)` | Terminate (forced kill) |

Signals are sent to the process group (`killpg`), not the individual process. This
ensures child processes spawned by the action are also signaled.

### Cross-user

Cross-user signal delivery is handled entirely by the embedded cross-user helper
(see `cross-user.md` and `embedded-cross-user-helper.md`). The helper process runs
as the target user and signals its child's process group locally via `killpg`,
so the worker-agent process never needs to deliver cross-user signals and no
special capabilities (e.g. `CAP_KILL`) are required.

## Cancelation Flow

### CancelMethod::Terminate

Immediate SIGKILL to the process group. Used for actions with `TerminateCancelMethod`.

### CancelMethod::NotifyThenTerminate

1. Write `cancel_info.json` to the session working directory (per
   [§5.3.2 `<CancelationMethodNotifyThenTerminate>`](https://github.com/OpenJobDescription/openjd-specifications/wiki/2023-09-Template-Schemas#532-cancelationmethodnotifythenterminate)):
   ```json
   {"NotifyEnd": "<yyyy>-<mm>-<dd>T<hh>:<mm>:<ss>Z"}
   ```
   The `NotifyEnd` value is an ISO 8601 UTC timestamp indicating when the notify
   period will end and the process will be forcefully terminated.
2. Send SIGTERM to the process (or process group)
3. Start a grace period timer (default: 120s for `onRun`, 30s for env scripts)
4. If the process doesn't exit within the grace period, send SIGKILL

The `cancel_info.json` file allows the action script to read the deadline and perform
graceful shutdown (save state, flush buffers, etc.).

## Cross-User Subprocess Launch

When `SubprocessConfig.user` is set and the user differs from the process user:

1. Generate a shell script wrapper:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/sh
   export VAR1='value1'
   export VAR2='value2'
   cd '/path/to/working/dir'
   exec /path/to/command arg1 arg2
   ```
2. Write the script to a randomized path in the helpers directory
   (`<helpers_dir>/_run_<uuid>.sh`). The helpers directory is 0o750
   (owner rwx, group r-x), preventing the job user from modifying
   scripts between write and execution.
3. Set permissions to allow the target user to execute it
4. Launch via `sudo -u <user> -i setsid -w <script_path>`

### Why a shell script wrapper

Environment variables can't be passed directly through `sudo -i` because the login shell
resets the environment. The Python library uses the same approach — generating a script
that exports env vars, changes directory, and execs the command.

The `shlex` crate is used to safely quote values in the generated script, preventing
shell injection.

## SubprocessResult

```rust
pub struct SubprocessResult {
    pub state: ActionState,    // Success, Failed, Canceled, Timeout
    pub exit_code: Option<i32>,
    pub stdout: String,        // Captured stdout (for non-streaming callers)
}
```

When `SubprocessConfig.debug_collect_stdout` is `false` (the default), the `stdout` field is
always empty — lines are still streamed through the filter and channel in real time.

## Internal Helper Functions

### format_command_for_log

```rust
pub(crate) fn format_command_for_log(args: &[String]) -> String
```

Formats a command argument list for log output using `shlex::try_join` for proper
quoting. Redacts any `openjd_redacted_env` values that appear in the command line
before logging, preventing secrets from appearing in log output.

### process_line

```rust
pub(crate) fn process_line(
    line: &str,
    filter: &mut ActionFilter,
    session_id: &str,
    message_tx: &UnboundedSender<ActionMessage>,
    saw_fail: &mut bool,
) -> (String, bool)
```

Processes a single stdout line through the `ActionFilter`, maps `FilterCallback` values
to `ActionMessage` variants, and sends them through the mpsc channel. Returns the
(possibly redacted) display string and whether the line should be passed through to
logging. Sets `saw_fail` when an `openjd_fail` directive is encountered.

This function is shared between `run_subprocess` (async path) and `run_via_helper`
(cross-user synchronous path).

## Windows Signal Delivery

### CTRL_BREAK_EVENT

Windows has no POSIX signals. For graceful cancellation (`NotifyThenTerminate`), the
subprocess module sends `CTRL_BREAK_EVENT` via the Win32 console API:

1. Detach from the current console (`FreeConsole`)
2. Attach to the target process's console (`AttachConsole(pid)`)
3. Send `GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent(CTRL_BREAK_EVENT, pid)`
4. Detach and re-attach to the parent console

When running as a Windows service (Session 0), console APIs don't work reliably.
The code detects this via `is_session_zero()` and falls back to immediate termination.

### Process Tree Killing

Windows doesn't have process groups like POSIX. Termination uses
`CreateToolhelp32Snapshot` to enumerate all processes, find descendants of the target
PID, and kill them leaf-to-root via `TerminateProcess`. This mirrors Python's
`_windows_process_killer.py`.

## Windows Cross-User Execution

On Windows, cross-user subprocess execution uses `CreateProcessAsUserW` (when a logon
token is available) or `CreateProcessWithLogonW` (username + password). The
`win32.rs` module handles:

- Logon token acquisition via `LogonUserW`
- Environment block construction for the target user
- Stdin/stdout pipe creation with inheritable handles
- Process creation with `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` flag

### CreateEnvironmentBlock profile-unload race

`environment_for_user()` retries `CreateEnvironmentBlock` on transient
profile-unload-race errors. The API reads from the user's registry hive at
`HKEY_USERS\<SID>`; Windows unloads that hive asynchronously when the
profile's refcount drops to zero. Back-to-back logons for the same user can
race with an in-progress unload and surface as:

- `0x800703FA` `ERROR_KEY_DELETED` — "Illegal operation attempted on a
  registry key that has been marked for deletion" (the symptom observed in
  the cross-user integration tests).
- `0x80070005` `E_ACCESSDENIED` — documented by Microsoft as a related
  symptom of the same race.

Retries are bounded at 5 attempts with geometric backoff (20/40/80/160 ms,
worst-case ~300 ms total). Non-transient errors return immediately so real
failures aren't hidden. The upstream Python implementation has a first-hand
comment describing this same class of error in `_win32/_locate_executable.py`
but uses a different mitigation (forcing handle cleanup between calls).
