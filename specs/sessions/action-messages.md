# Real-Time Action Message Streaming

## Problem

The OpenJD specification defines `openjd_*` stdout messages that actions emit during
execution to convey progress, status, environment variable changes, and failure reasons
to the runtime. The spec says these are intercepted to "convey information about the
Action to the render management system" — implying real-time delivery, not batch.

## ActionMessage

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum ActionMessage {
    Progress(f64),
    Status(String),
    Fail(String),
    SetEnv { name: String, value: String },
    UnsetEnv { name: String },
    RedactedEnv { name: String, value: String },
    ServiceReady(String),
    CancelMarkFailed { fail_message: String },
}
```

### `ServiceReady` — `openjd_service_ready: <message>` (RFC 0009)

The `SERVICE` extension adds one message. `ActionFilter` parses it exactly
like the others (`openjd_service_ready`, then `: `, then a non-empty payload;
near-misses are ordinary output), echoes it under `echo_openjd_directives`,
and the subprocess loop forwards it as `ActionMessage::ServiceReady(message)`.
It carries no cancel flag.

Which consumer honors it is a scope decision, not the filter's:

| Consumer | Effect |
|---|---|
| `ServiceSession` background `onRun` driver, readiness type `STDOUT` | The first line makes the instance READY with `message`; later lines have no further effect; a line drained after `onRun` exited cannot (onRun exit wins). |
| `ServiceSession` `onRun` driver, readiness type `TCP_CONNECT` | Logged as ignored. |
| `ServiceSession` `onEnter` / `onExit` | Logged as ignored. |
| `Session` (Environment actions, Tasks, ad-hoc subprocesses) | Ignored silently in `apply_message`. |

See [service-session.md](service-session.md) for the per-action message table
of a Service Session (notably: `SetEnv` / `UnsetEnv` / `RedactedEnv` /
`CancelMarkFailed` are honored from a Service's `onEnter` only and are logged
as ignored from `onRun` and `onExit`).

### Why an enum instead of a trait or callback

The Python library uses a `logging.Filter` that mutates session state directly from
within the filter callback. This works in Python (GIL protects concurrent access) but
would require `Arc<Mutex<Session>>` in Rust.

An enum sent through a channel decouples the producer (subprocess stdout loop) from the
consumer (session state machine). The session processes messages with `&mut self`, no
locks needed.

### Why CancelMarkFailed carries a fail_message

When the `ActionFilter` detects a malformed `openjd_*` directive (e.g., wrong case or
missing space after colon), it emits `CancelMarkFailed` to cancel the action and mark
it as failed. The `fail_message` field provides context about what was malformed, which
the session stores as `action_fail_message` and reports via the callback. Without this
field, the consumer would only know the action was canceled but not why.

## Channel Architecture

```
┌──────────────┐     ActionMessage      ┌─────────────────┐
│  subprocess  │ ──── mpsc channel ───► │ Session          │
│  stdout loop │                        │ drive_action()   │
└──────────────┘                        └─────────────────┘
       │                                     │
       │ ActionFilter                        ├─ update progress/status
       │ parses lines                        ├─ apply env var changes
       │                                     ├─ trigger cancel on Fail
       │                                     └─ invoke user callback
```

### Why unbounded channel

`tokio::sync::mpsc::unbounded_channel` is used instead of a bounded channel because:

1. Backpressure on stdout would stall the subprocess, potentially causing deadlocks
   if the subprocess is waiting for stdout to drain before exiting
2. The message rate is bounded by subprocess stdout throughput (one message per line),
   which is inherently limited by I/O
3. The consumer (`drive_action`) processes messages as fast as they arrive — there's
   no slow consumer problem

A bounded channel would add complexity (choosing a buffer size, handling `SendError`)
without meaningful benefit.

## Session::drive_action

The core async loop that runs an action to completion while processing messages:

```rust
async fn drive_action(
    &mut self,
    action_future: impl Future<Output = Result<SubprocessResult, SessionError>>,
    mut message_rx: mpsc::UnboundedReceiver<ActionMessage>,
) -> ActionResult {
    tokio::pin!(action_future);
    loop {
        tokio::select! {
            result = &mut action_future => {
                // Subprocess exited — drain remaining messages
                while let Ok(msg) = message_rx.try_recv() {
                    self.apply_message(msg);
                }
                return self.finalize_action(result);
            }
            Some(msg) = message_rx.recv() => {
                self.apply_message(msg);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Why this concurrency model works without locks

The subprocess future and the message receiver run in the same `async` task via
`tokio::select!`. Only one branch executes at a time (cooperative scheduling), so
`&mut self` is safe. The subprocess sends messages through the channel — it never
touches session state directly.

This is fundamentally different from the Python approach where the `ActionMonitoringFilter`
runs on a daemon thread and mutates session state through the GIL. The Rust approach
eliminates all shared mutable state.

### Why drain after subprocess exit

When the subprocess exits, there may be messages in the channel that were sent but not
yet received (the channel has internal buffering). Draining ensures no messages are lost,
particularly `SetEnv`/`UnsetEnv` messages that affect subsequent actions.

## Callback Invocation

After each `apply_message`, the user callback is invoked with the current `ActionStatus`:

```rust
fn apply_message(&mut self, msg: ActionMessage) {
    match msg {
        ActionMessage::Progress(v) => self.action_status.progress = Some(v),
        ActionMessage::Status(s) => self.action_status.status_message = Some(s),
        // ... etc
    }
    if let Some(ref callback) = self.callback {
        callback(&self.session_id, &self.action_status);
    }
}
```

This matches the Python library's behavior where the callback fires on every directive.
The worker agent uses this to forward real-time progress to the Deadline service.
