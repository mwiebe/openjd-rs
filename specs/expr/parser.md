# Parser

## Overview

The expression language reuses a subset of Python's expression syntax (RFC 0005 §Design Constraints,
item 7). Rather than writing a custom parser, the crate uses `ruff_python_parser` to
parse expressions into a Python AST, then walks the AST with a custom evaluator.

Defined in `eval/parse.rs`.

## Parser Selection: ruff_python_parser

The `ruff_python_parser` from [astral-sh/ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) is
used via the `rustpython-ruff_python_parser` crate on crates.io.

The `rustpython-ruff_python_parser` package on crates.io is a republished version of
the same code as `ruff_python_parser` in the `astral-sh/ruff` monorepo. The RustPython
project republishes it under this name. Users seeing `rustpython-ruff_python_parser` in
`Cargo.toml` or `Cargo.lock` should know it is the same parser, not a fork.

**Why ruff over rustpython-parser:**

- rustpython-parser's README states it is "superseded by" the ruff parser
- ruff is actively maintained (daily commits, backed by Astral)
- rustpython-parser has had no substantive code changes since early 2025

```toml
ruff_python_parser = { package = "rustpython-ruff_python_parser", version = "0.15.8" }
ruff_python_ast = { package = "rustpython-ruff_python_ast", version = "0.15.8" }
```

## Keyword Renaming

Python keywords like `if`, `is`, `not`, `and`, `or`, `in` cannot appear as attribute
names in Python syntax. But the OpenJD expression language needs them to work after `.`
because job parameters can have any name — a parameter named `def` or `is` must be
accessible as `Param.def` or `Param.is`.

The solution:

1. Attempt to parse the expression
2. If parsing fails with ruff's "Expected an identifier, but found a
   keyword" error, inspect the **error span**: if the span is
   immediately preceded by `.` and its text is a Python keyword, it is
   a contextual keyword use
3. Replace exactly that span with a same-length placeholder identifier
   to preserve column offsets
4. Re-parse with the placeholders
5. Record the renames in `keyword_renames: HashMap<String, String>` so the evaluator
   can map placeholder names back to the original attribute names

Locating the keyword via the parse-error span (all offsets are byte
offsets; for multiline sources they are mapped back through the
parenthesis wrapping) rather than scanning the source for `.keyword`
is what keeps string literals safe: a literal like `'a.class'` never
produces a parse error, so it is never rewritten. This matches the
Python implementation's `ast_parse_keyword_context()`, which likewise
derives the keyword position from the `SyntaxError` offset.

Replacement identifiers are enumerated systematically (first char from
`[a-zA-Z]`, rest from `[a-zA-Z0-9]`) and each candidate is verified
absent from the source before use. If the space is exhausted — the
source contains every same-length candidate — parsing fails with a
clean error rather than picking a name that collides with a legitimate
attribute. At evaluation time, renames are resolved by **exact dotted-
path component match** (`resolve_keyword_renames`), never by substring
replacement, so replacements that are prefixes of one another (e.g.
`aa` and `aaaa`) cannot corrupt each other's paths.

### Reverse mapping at evaluation

The parse-time replacement only rewrites the source; the resulting AST contains the
placeholder names (`xf` for `if`, `xlse` for `else`, etc.). The evaluator's
`eval_attribute` consults the `keyword_renames` map whenever it constructs a symbol
lookup key from an AST `Attribute` node, so a parsed-as-`Param.xf` access becomes a
real lookup of `Param.if` in the symbol table. Error messages also undo the
placeholder: `ExpressionError::with_node` uses the original source text (which still
contains `if`), so users never see the placeholder in diagnostics.

## AST Validation

After parsing, the AST is validated against an allowlist of allowed node types. This
rejects Python features that are syntactically valid but not part of the expression
language:

**Allowed nodes:**
- Expression, IfExp, BoolOp, UnaryOp, Compare, BinOp
- Subscript, Slice, Call, Attribute, Name, Constant
- List, ListComp, comprehension

## Depth Limit

The parser and evaluator both enforce a maximum AST nesting depth of
[`MAX_EXPRESSION_DEPTH`](../../crates/openjd-expr/src/eval/parse.rs) (currently
**64**). This exists solely to prevent stack exhaustion on pathological inputs —
not to constrain legitimate expressions, which rarely nest more than ~10 levels.

Three independent mechanisms work together:

1. **Absolute input-size cap.** `ParsedExpression::new` rejects any source
   longer than [`MAX_PARSE_INPUT_LEN`](../../crates/openjd-expr/src/eval/parse.rs)
   (currently **64 KB**) before invoking the parser. This bounds the parser's
   worst-case recursion depth at source length: a recursive-descent parser
   cannot recurse more times than there are input characters to consume.

2. **Short-input fast path + long-input worker thread.** Inputs of at most
   **200** characters (`FAST_PATH_INPUT_LEN`) parse directly on the current
   thread. Two things together make this safe: a recursive-descent parser
   cannot recurse more times than there are input characters to consume,
   and the ruff parser's empirical overflow threshold on Rust's default
   2 MB thread stack is well above 200 frames (≥ 500 observed in release
   builds). Longer inputs run on a dedicated thread with a 32 MB stack via
   `std::thread::Builder::stack_size`, which comfortably accommodates any
   input up to `MAX_PARSE_INPUT_LEN` even in debug builds. The
   worker-thread approach lets us parse *any* AST shape safely without
   enumerating which token patterns drive parser recursion — whatever
   shape the grammar produces, the parser has enough stack to complete.

   The fast-path threshold is deliberately decoupled from
   `MAX_EXPRESSION_DEPTH`: the depth cap is a semantic abuse ceiling on
   AST nesting, while the fast-path threshold is a pragmatic tuning knob
   for parser stack-safety on the caller's thread. Real-world template
   expressions are nearly always under 100 characters, so 200 keeps the
   vast majority of inputs on the cheap path.

3. **Structural AST walker.** After parsing succeeds, `validate_structure`
   carries a `depth` counter and bumps it on every recursive descent into
   a child node. If the counter exceeds `MAX_EXPRESSION_DEPTH`, validation
   fails with `ExpressionErrorKind::ExpressionTooDeep`. Chained comparisons
   (`a < b < c < ...`) are also checked against the limit via their
   comparators vector length.

The evaluator applies a parallel check: `Evaluator::evaluate` — the single
entry point through which every sub-node evaluation flows — carries a
`recursion_depth` field and checks it on entry. ASTs that slip past the
parser-phase check (e.g., a long left-associative binop chain `1+1+...+1`
which produces a deep-but-syntactically-shallow source) are caught here
before they can exhaust the evaluator's stack.

Rust threads default to 2 MB of stack, and Rust cannot recover from stack
overflow via `std::panic::catch_unwind` — it aborts the process. The input
cap + worker thread + depth walker + evaluator guard together ensure that
no input to `ParsedExpression::new` or `Evaluator::evaluate` can cause a
process abort.

Exceeding the limit returns `ExpressionErrorKind::ExpressionTooDeep { depth,
limit: 64 }` with normal caret formatting.

**Rejected with descriptive errors:**
| Node | Error message |
|------|---------------|
| Lambda | Lambda expressions are not supported |
| Dict, Set | Dict/Set literals are not supported |
| SetComp, DictComp, GeneratorExp | Only list comprehensions are supported |
| Tuple | Tuple literals are not supported; use a list instead |
| NamedExpr (`:=`) | Walrus operator is not supported |
| Starred (`*x`) | Star expressions are not supported |
| JoinedStr (f-strings) | f-strings are not supported |
| Bitwise ops (`&`, `\|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`) | Bitwise operations are not supported |
| `is` / `is not` | Identity comparison is not supported; use == or != |
| Keyword arguments | Keyword arguments are not supported |

**Structural checks:**
- List comprehensions: max 1 generator, max 1 `if` clause per generator
- No tuple unpacking in comprehension targets
- Loop variables must start with a lowercase letter (convention from spec)

## JSON Literal Normalization

The expression language accepts JSON-style literals alongside Python-style:

- `null` → treated as Python `None` → `ExprValue::Null`
- `true` → treated as Python `True` → `ExprValue::Bool(true)`
- `false` → treated as Python `False` → `ExprValue::Bool(false)`

These are normalized during AST validation by checking `Name` nodes against these
identifiers.

## Symbol Collection

After parsing, three sets are collected from the AST:

| Set | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `accessed_symbols` | All variable references (Name and dotted Attribute chains), excluding loop variables and function names |
| `called_functions` | All function/method names invoked |
| `local_bindings` | Loop variable names from list comprehensions |

These are used by the model layer for template validation — checking that all referenced
symbols exist in the parameter definitions, and that no comprehension variable shadows
a parameter name.

## Multi-line Expressions

Expressions can span multiple lines via implicit line continuation (wrapping in
parentheses). The parser handles this by:

1. Wrapping the expression in `(...)` before parsing
2. Adjusting line numbers in the resulting AST back to the original
3. Error messages show only the relevant line with correct column offsets

## Divergence from Python

The Python implementation uses `ast.parse(expr, mode='eval')` from the standard library.
The Rust implementation uses `ruff_python_parser::parse_expression()` which produces
`ruff_python_ast` types instead of Python `ast` types. The AST structures are nearly
identical, so the evaluator logic translates directly.
