# Function Library

## Overview

`FunctionLibrary` is a registry of function overloads with signature-based multiple
dispatch.

Defined in `function_library.rs` (dispatch and registration) and `default_library.rs`
(default library construction). Function implementations live in `functions/`.

## Design Rationale

Making function signatures first-class data provides four key capabilities:

1. **Static type checking** — return types can be determined from argument types without
   running the expression, which the model layer needs for template validation
2. **Extensibility** — host-context functions like `apply_path_mapping` are added by
   merging a separate library, without modifying the evaluator
3. **Single source of type truth** — operator and function type rules live in signatures
   rather than being duplicated between dispatch and type inference
4. **Introspection** — callers can query whether a function call is valid for given types,
   enabling better error messages and tooling

## FunctionEntry

Each registered overload pairs a type signature with a function implementation:

```rust
pub type FunctionImpl = Arc<
    dyn Fn(&mut dyn EvalContext, &[ExprValue]) -> Result<ExprValue, ExpressionError>
        + Send
        + Sync,
>;

pub struct FunctionEntry {
    pub signature: ExprType,     // TypeCode::Signature — e.g., (int, int) -> int
    pub implementation: FunctionImpl,
}

pub struct FunctionLibrary {
    functions: HashMap<String, Vec<FunctionEntry>>,
}
```

The implementation is an `Arc<dyn Fn … + Send + Sync>` — not a bare `fn`
pointer — so closures that capture environment (host state, AWS clients,
config) can be registered alongside plain functions. `Arc` (rather than `Box`)
keeps `FunctionLibrary` `Clone`, which many call sites rely on when cloning the
default library to add host-context extensions.

Whether host-only functions like `apply_path_mapping` are available on a
library instance is determined by whether they are registered — check with
`get_signatures("apply_path_mapping")`. `FunctionLibrary::for_profile`
registers them when the profile's `host_context` is
`HostContext::WithRules(...)` or `HostContext::Unresolved`.

Function pointers and closures both work — `Arc<dyn Fn + Send + Sync>` is
`Clone` and thread-safe, preserving `FunctionLibrary: Clone + Send + Sync`.
Functions that need evaluator state (path format, resource counting, regex
cache) access it through the `EvalContext` trait. Functions that need *host*
state (e.g. path mapping rules for `apply_path_mapping`) capture it via a
closure registered at library-construction time — see
[Host Context](#host-context) below.

## EvalContext Trait

```rust
pub trait EvalContext {
    fn path_format(&self) -> PathFormat;
    fn count_op(&mut self) -> Result<(), ExpressionError>;
    fn count_ops(&mut self, n: usize) -> Result<(), ExpressionError>;
    fn count_string_ops(&mut self, len: usize) -> Result<(), ExpressionError>;
    /// Pre-check that an allocation of `bytes` would not exceed the memory
    /// limit. Call before large allocations to avoid temporarily exceeding
    /// the limit.
    fn check_memory(&self, bytes: usize) -> Result<(), ExpressionError>;
    fn get_or_compile_regex(&mut self, pattern: &str) -> Result<regex::Regex, ExpressionError> {
        // Default: compile without caching
        regex::RegexBuilder::new(pattern)
            .size_limit(1 << 20)
            .build()
            .map_err(|e| ExpressionError::new(format!("Invalid regex: {e}")))
    }
}
```

`get_or_compile_regex` has a default implementation that compiles the pattern on every
call via `RegexBuilder` with a 1 MiB compiled-program size limit (to defend against
adversarial patterns). The evaluator overrides it with a caching version that stores
compiled regexes for reuse across repeated calls with the same pattern — the cache
is per-evaluation, not global.

The evaluator implements `EvalContext` directly. This trait boundary prevents function
implementations from calling evaluation methods (like `evaluate` or `dispatch`),
enforcing the separation between evaluation control flow and pure function logic.

### Preflighting Output Budgets

Functions that can substantially amplify their inputs preflight a conservative
output-size bound so an over-limit call fails before building the result:

1. Compute the exact output size or a conservative upper bound.
2. Charge `count_ops` / `count_string_ops` for work proportional to that size.
3. Call `check_memory` for the projected allocation. This is a stateless
   pre-check; `dispatch` still tracks the actual returned value.
4. Only then build the result.

String-producing functions use the internal `StringOutputBudget` guard for
steps 2 through 4. `reserve` charges the work and checks the byte bound before
construction; `finish` debug-asserts that the rendered string fits that bound
before returning it for normal dispatch tracking.

The following function families use this pattern:

- **Padded strings** (`zfill`, `center`, `ljust`, `rjust`) use the shared
  `preflight_padding` helper in `string.rs`. It charges input traversal before
  counting characters, clamps negative widths to zero (matching Python), then
  charges generated padding bytes and checks the exact output byte count.
  `zfill` borrows string and preserved-float input text until this preflight
  succeeds, and calls the same crate-visible helper from `misc.rs`. For `center`,
  odd padding places the extra space on the left only when the requested width is
  also odd, matching Python; otherwise the extra space is on the right.
- **`repr_py` output contract.** Expression Language §2.2.6 defines `repr_py` as
  following Python's `repr`, and this is what that means here. For the
  string-valued inputs — `string`, `path`, and lists of either — the output is
  byte-identical to CPython's `repr` and parses back as a literal equal to the
  input, for every Unicode scalar value. The delimiter is `'`, switching to `"`
  only when the value holds a `'` and no `"`, so a value holding both keeps `'`
  and escapes it. Inside the literal, `\` and the delimiter are
  backslash-escaped, `\n`, `\r` and `\t` take their named forms, and any other
  non-printable code point takes the narrowest numeric form that fits: `\xNN` up
  to `U+00FF`, `\uNNNN` up to `U+FFFF`, `\UNNNNNNNN` above. Non-printable means
  the Unicode general category is `C*` or `Z*` with `U+0020` excepted, which is
  `Py_UNICODE_ISPRINTABLE` inverted.

  The predicate reads the generated `NONPRINTABLE` table
  (`functions/unicode_tables.rs`), so it answers from the same pinned CPython as
  `str.isalpha`, `str.isspace` and every other Python-parity classifier in the
  crate. That makes the parity exact rather than approximate, and it is why this
  module does not read a Unicode-property crate: a second data source could drift
  from the first with nothing in the build detecting it. The
  `the_pinned_unicode_version_has_not_moved` test asserts the pin, so
  regenerating on a newer Unicode fails a test instead of silently changing which
  code points `repr_py` escapes. Below `U+0080` the answer is fixed for all time
  and `py_escape` decides it arithmetically, skipping the table.

  Numeric inputs do not take this path. `write_repr_py` renders `Float`'s
  preserved `original` spelling verbatim and unquoted, on the assumption that a
  `Float64`'s text is numeric; `Float64::with_str` does not enforce that, so the
  assumption is a caller contract rather than an invariant. See
  [issue 328](https://github.com/OpenJobDescription/openjd-rs/issues/328).
  `RangeExpr` is quoted through the shared writer, and its `Display` emits only
  digits and `-`, `:`, `,`, so nothing there can need escaping.

  `py_escape::write_py_string_literal` is the single implementation. `repr_py`
  and `ExprValue::repr_python` both call it, so the two cannot disagree about how
  a value is spelled. `repr_pwsh` deliberately does not share it, because
  PowerShell doubles `''` and admits a raw newline.

- **Representation functions** (`repr_py`, `repr_json`, `repr_sh`,
  `repr_cmd`, `repr_pwsh`) use `preflight_repr`. It first charges the recursive
  list item count from `count_list_items`, then obtains a byte bound from
  `output_bound`. Escaped strings use one deliberately broad six-times
  expansion ceiling plus structural delimiter overhead; the estimator does
  not duplicate any renderer escape table. Six covers every escape any renderer
  emits: the widest is `repr_py`'s `\UNNNNNNNN` at ten characters, which only
  applies above `U+FFFF` where the input is four UTF-8 bytes, and the worst
  actual ratio is `\x00` at four bytes out for one in. Unit tests render
  adversarial strings and nested lists and assert that every bound covers the
  result, one string per escape width, and debug builds repeat that assertion at
  each function boundary. `repr_sh`
  accepts only the canonical `string`, `path`, `list[string]`, and `list[path]`
  inputs, plus an internal `list[nulltype]` overload for an empty list literal.
  `repr_cmd` accepts `string` and `list[string]`; internal exact `path`,
  `list[path]`, and `list[nulltype]` overloads implement standard path-to-string
  and empty-list behavior without allocating a scalar path coercion before the
  output preflight. Unsupported lists are rejected during signature dispatch.
- **`string()` on a list** renders a JSON array whose element strings are
  escaped, so it reuses the same bound via `preflight_display_list`. Scalars
  render as themselves and are not charged. See
  [values.md](values.md#list-display-strings).
- **Amplifying string operations** (`replace`, `join`) compute their projected
  output from a worst-case non-overlapping replacement count or from
  element/separator lengths, then reserve the bound before constructing the
  output.
- **Slicing** (`__getitem__` with a slice on a `string` or `list`) computes the
  number of selected elements arithmetically (`slice_len`, tested to agree
  with the lazy index iterator `slice_indices`) before building anything. A
  list slice reserves the result's exact capacity once through
  `BudgetedVec::with_capacity`, which checks `count × size_of::<ExprValue>()`,
  then charges each element as it is pushed; `make_list_checked` then checks
  again with the elements' heap sizes. No index vector is allocated. A
  string slice checks
  `min(input bytes, 4 × count)`: every selected character is a distinct
  character of the input, so both are upper bounds. It then copies the
  characters directly from the input, with no `Vec<char>` or index vector,
  and shrinks the result buffer so the tracked size equals the actual size.
  The input is still tracked during the call (dispatch releases it
  afterwards), so the input and the projected result count together.

## Registration

```rust
let mut lib = FunctionLibrary::new();

// Plain function pointer
lib.register("abs", ExprType::signature(vec![ExprType::INT], ExprType::INT), abs_int);

// From spec notation string (convenient for bulk registration)
lib.register_sig("abs", "(int) -> int", abs_int);
lib.register_sig("abs", "(float) -> float", abs_float);
lib.register_sig("min", "(list[T1]) -> T1", min_list);

// Closures work too — useful for host-integrated functions that wrap
// captured state (AWS clients, config, caches). Must be `Send + Sync + 'static`.
let prefix = "host-".to_string();
lib.register_sig(
    "brand",
    "(string) -> string",
    move |_ctx: &mut dyn EvalContext, a: &[ExprValue]| match &a[0] {
        ExprValue::String(s) => Ok(ExprValue::String(format!("{prefix}{s}"))),
        _ => Err(ExpressionError::type_error("expected string")),
    },
);
```

## Three-Phase Dispatch

```rust
library.call(name, &args, ctx)
```

1. **Exact non-generic match** — signature params match arg types exactly (types derived from args)
2. **Non-generic with coercion** — try implicit coercions (INT→FLOAT, PATH→STRING);
   skip receiver coercion for method calls to prevent `42.upper()`
3. **Generic match** — bind type variables (T, T1, T2, T3) and check consistency. A
   variable bound by two parameters reconciles through `types::unify_binding`: the
   same type, or a coercible pair (`int`/`float`, `path`/`string`, `range_expr`/`list[int]`)
   which binds the wider type, and `any` reconciles with anything; a `list[<var>]`
   parameter matched by `list[nulltype]` (the empty list) binds only weakly, so a
   sibling parameter's binding wins and a lone one still yields `nulltype`

The method-vs-function distinction is made by the evaluator before dispatch:
`eval_call` transforms `obj.method(args)` into `method(obj, args)` via UFCS and sets
a per-call flag on the dispatch indicating that position 0 is a receiver. The library
honors that flag in phase 2 by declining to coerce arg 0. Ordinary function calls
carry no such flag and coerce all arguments uniformly.

If no match is found, the error message includes:
- The function name (using operator symbols for dunders: `__add__` → `+`)
- The argument types provided
- Available signatures for that name
- "Did you mean?" suggestions via edit distance for unknown function names

## Operator Mapping

Operators are registered as dunder-named functions:

| Operator | Function name | Example signatures |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| `+` | `__add__` | `(int, int) -> int`, `(string, string) -> string`, `(path, string) -> path`, `(list[T1], list[T2]) -> list[T3]` |
| `-` | `__sub__` | `(int, int) -> int`, `(float, float) -> float` |
| `*` | `__mul__` | `(int, int) -> int`, `(string, int) -> string`, `(list[T1], int) -> list[T1]` |
| `/` | `__truediv__` | `(int, int) -> float`, `(path, string) -> path`, `(path, path) -> path` |
| `//` | `__floordiv__` | `(int, int) -> int`, `(float, float) -> int` |
| `%` | `__mod__` | `(int, int) -> int`, `(float, float) -> float` |
| `**` | `__pow__` | `(int, int) -> float\|int`, `(float, float) -> float` |
| unary `-` | `__neg__` | `(int) -> int`, `(float) -> float` |
| unary `+` | `__pos__` | `(int) -> int`, `(float) -> float` |
| `not` | `__not__` | `(bool) -> bool` |
| `==` | `__eq__` | `(T1, T2) -> bool` |
| `!=` | `__ne__` | `(T1, T2) -> bool` |
| `<` | `__lt__` | `(T1, T2) -> bool` |
| `<=` | `__le__` | `(T1, T2) -> bool` |
| `>` | `__gt__` | `(T1, T2) -> bool` |
| `>=` | `__ge__` | `(T1, T2) -> bool` |
| `x[i]` | `__getitem__` | `(list[T1], int) -> T1`, `(string, int) -> string`, `(range_expr, int) -> int`, plus slice overloads |
| `in` | `__contains__` | `(list[T], T) -> bool`, `(string, string) -> bool`, `(range_expr, int \| float) -> bool` |
| `not in` | `__not_contains__` | Same as `__contains__` |

The list overload uses one type variable, as the spec writes it
(`__contains__(list: list[T], item: T)`): the item must be the list's element
type or implicitly coercible to it, so `'1' in [1, 2, 3]` and `'a' in
range_expr('1-3')` fail signature resolution at validation time instead of
evaluating to `false`. Because membership dispatches container-first, the
reverse of the source order, and a nested-list-in-flat-list test would print two
identical types, the diagnostic names the roles: `Cannot use 'in' operator: item
of type string is not compatible with the element type int of list[int]`.
Membership is still decided by value equality once the types agree, and the
language's non-destructive coercions are honoured when binding `T` from both
arguments (see "Type variable unification" in type-system.md): `1 in [1.0,
2.0]`, `1.0 in [1, 2]`, `path(['/a']) in ['/a']` and `1.0 in range_expr('1-3')`
all evaluate and compare by value, and the empty list `[]` accepts any item
type. The earlier registration `(list[T1], T2)` matched Python's
value-equality semantics and let a template whose item type could never match
pass static validation; it was replaced because the spec's static type checking
exists to catch exactly that.

Comparison operands go through the same dispatch when they are unresolved, so
the check reaches parameter references: `Param.Name in [1, 2]` with a STRING
parameter is refused at validation. The ordering operators remain `(T1, T2)`
and their cross-type refusal is still a run-time one inside `do_compare`.

## Property Access

Properties are registered as `__property_NAME__` functions:

```rust
lib.register_sig("__property_name__", "(path) -> string", path_name);
lib.register_sig("__property_stem__", "(path) -> string", path_stem);
lib.register_sig("__property_suffix__", "(path) -> string", path_suffix);
lib.register_sig("__property_suffixes__", "(path) -> list[string]", path_suffixes);
lib.register_sig("__property_parent__", "(path) -> path", path_parent);
lib.register_sig("__property_parts__", "(path) -> list[string]", path_parts);
```

The evaluator's `eval_attribute` dispatches to `__property_NAME__` when the attribute
isn't found as a variable in the symbol table.

## Static Type Derivation

The library supports type-level queries without evaluation:

```rust
// What type does len(list[int]) return?
lib.derive_return_type("len", &[ExprType::list(ExprType::INT)])  // → Some(ExprType::INT)

// What type is path.name?
lib.get_property_type(&ExprType::PATH, "name")  // → Some(ExprType::STRING)
```

This is used by the model layer for template validation with unresolved values.

### Non-Union Fast Path

When no argument type is a union, `derive_return_type` tries each registered signature
in two passes:

1. **Exact match** — `match_call` checks each parameter against the argument type,
   binding type variables (T1, T2, etc.) and checking consistency
2. **Coerced match** — applies implicit coercions (INT→FLOAT, PATH→STRING) to the
   argument types and retries

This is O(S) where S is the number of signatures for the function name.

### Union Path: Per-Signature Recursive Matching

When any argument is a union type (e.g., `union[int, string]`), the function must
determine all possible return types across all valid type combinations. The naive
approach — generating the Cartesian product of all union members upfront — is O(M^N)
where M is the max union size and N is the argument count.

Instead, `derive_return_type` uses per-signature recursive matching (matching the
Python implementation's `_match_signature` approach):

1. Flatten each argument's types into a set (union members + implicit coercions)
2. For each registered signature, recurse through argument positions:
   - At position `i`, try each type from arg `i`'s set against the signature's
     parameter `i`
   - If `param.match_type(arg_type)` fails → prune (skip all deeper combinations)
   - If a type variable binding conflicts with an earlier binding → prune
   - If all positions match → record the substituted return type
3. Collect, deduplicate, and return as a union (or single type if all paths agree)

This prunes aggressively in practice because most signatures are concrete. For example,
with signature `(int, int) -> int` and args `[union[int, string, path], union[int, float]]`:
- The Cartesian product approach generates 6 combinations and checks each
- The recursive approach tries `int` at arg 0 → matches → recurses to arg 1 (2 checks),
  then tries `string` at arg 0 → fails immediately (0 further checks), then `path` →
  fails immediately. Total: 4 checks instead of 6

The savings grow with more arguments and larger unions. For generic signatures (e.g.,
`(T1, T2) -> bool` for comparison operators), pruning is less effective since most
types match, but binding conflict detection still prunes some branches (e.g., `(T, T)`
rejects `(int, string)`).

## Sub-Library Composition

Each function category is a module-private free function returning its own
`FunctionLibrary`. The default library merges them inside `default_library.rs`:

```rust
fn build_default_library() -> FunctionLibrary {
    FunctionLibrary::new()
        .merge(arithmetic())
        .merge(string_ops())
        .merge(list_ops())
        .merge(comparison())
        .merge(math_ops())
        .merge(string_functions())
        .merge(list_functions())
        .merge(conversion())
        .merge(path_ops())
        .merge(repr_ops())
        .merge(regex_ops())
        .merge(misc())
}
```

The category builders (`arithmetic()`, `string_ops()`, …) are not part of the public
API; the publicly exported entry point is
[`FunctionLibrary::for_profile(&ExprProfile)`](#for_profile).

## Caching

The default library skeleton (no host context) is immutable and contains only
`fn` pointers, so it is `Send + Sync`. A crate-private `LazyLock<FunctionLibrary>`
holds it; `FunctionLibrary::for_profile` builds on top of it per the profile's
host-context setting and caches the result in a per-profile `Arc` map keyed
on the rules-independent portion of the profile (see
[profile.md § ProfileKey](../../crates/openjd-expr/src/profile.rs)).

```rust
pub fn for_profile(profile: &ExprProfile) -> Arc<FunctionLibrary>;
```

Profiles that differ only in their `Arc<Vec<PathMappingRule>>` share a single
cached no-host skeleton; the rules closure is applied on top as a cheap clone
per call.

## Host Context

Host-context functions (like `apply_path_mapping`) need host-supplied state
(path mapping rules) that the expression evaluator has no knowledge of. They
are registered on a library obtained from `FunctionLibrary::for_profile`
when the profile carries a non-`None` host context:

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use openjd_expr::{ExprProfile, FunctionLibrary, HostContext, PathMappingRule};

let rules: Vec<PathMappingRule> = /* ... */;

// Runtime: real rules baked into an `apply_path_mapping` closure.
let profile = ExprProfile::current()
    .with_host_context(HostContext::with_rules(rules));
let lib: Arc<FunctionLibrary> = FunctionLibrary::for_profile(&profile);
assert!(!lib.get_signatures("apply_path_mapping").is_empty());
```

`HostContext::with_rules(Vec<PathMappingRule>)` takes ownership of the rules
and wraps them in an `Arc` internally. Callers that already have an
`Arc<Vec<PathMappingRule>>` can construct `HostContext::WithRules(arc)`
directly. The `apply_path_mapping` closure captures the `Arc` by reference,
so many libraries built from the same rules share a single allocation.

For template validation at job creation time (when path mapping rules aren't
available yet), use `HostContext::Unresolved`. This registers the
host-context function signatures with stub implementations that return
`Unresolved(PATH)`:

```rust
let profile = ExprProfile::current()
    .with_host_context(HostContext::Unresolved);
let lib = FunctionLibrary::for_profile(&profile);
assert!(!lib.get_signatures("apply_path_mapping").is_empty());
```

This allows the type checker to verify that calls to host-context functions
are well-typed without requiring actual rules. The validation stub takes no
arguments — rules don't matter for a signature-only check.

### Low-level primitives

`FunctionLibrary::for_profile` composes internally from two crate-public
free functions in `default_library`, exposed for advanced callers that
want to layer host-context functions onto a custom-built library:

```rust
pub fn default_library::register_host_context_functions(
    lib: &mut FunctionLibrary,
    rules: Arc<Vec<PathMappingRule>>,
);

pub fn default_library::register_unresolved_host_context_functions(
    lib: &mut FunctionLibrary,
);
```

Most callers should not call these directly — go through
`FunctionLibrary::for_profile(&profile)` to get the cached result. These
primitives are documented in [public-api.md § Default Library](public-api.md#default-library-default_library).

### Rule-change semantics

Rules are captured at the point `FunctionLibrary::for_profile` resolves a
`HostContext::WithRules(rules)` profile. The `apply_path_mapping` closure
holds an immutable `Arc<Vec<PathMappingRule>>` reference for the library's
lifetime. If the host's rules change (e.g. `openjd-sessions` accumulates
path mapping rules across let-binding evaluations), the host must rebuild
the library by calling `for_profile` with a new rules-carrying profile:

```rust
// Rebuild with updated rules.
let updated_profile = ExprProfile::current()
    .with_host_context(HostContext::with_rules(new_rules));
let updated_lib = FunctionLibrary::for_profile(&updated_profile);
```

The underlying no-host skeleton is cached and shared across `for_profile`
calls, so the per-call cost is a `HashMap` clone plus one
`apply_path_mapping` registration — not a full library rebuild.

### Host-Context Function Inventory

The host-context namespace is deliberately small. The only function currently
registered is:

| Function | Signature | Runtime behavior | Validation stub |
|---|---|---|---|
| `apply_path_mapping` | `(string) -> path` | Applies the closure-captured path mapping rules to the string, returning a `path` in the configured output format (or the original string normalized to that format if no rule matches). | Returns `Unresolved(path)` so type checking proceeds without real rules. |

Adding a new host-context function that captures host state:

1. Write a closure factory `make_foo_fn(state: Arc<State>) -> impl Fn(&mut dyn EvalContext, &[ExprValue]) -> R + Send + Sync + 'static`.
2. Register it from `register_host_context_functions(lib, ...)` using `lib.register_sig(name, signature, make_foo_fn(state.clone()))`.
3. Register a matching stub in `register_unresolved_host_context_functions` that returns `Unresolved(expected_type)`.

Functions that don't need host state can be plain fn pointers registered in
the default library category modules (see `default_library.rs`).

## Function Coverage

228 Rust signatures registered in `default_library.rs` (counted over
`FunctionLibrary::for_profile(&ExprProfile::current())`). All function names from the
specification are present, including the `join_host_port` / `split_host_port` /
`is_ipv4` / `is_ipv6` family that the `SERVICE` extension (RFC 0009) adds to §2.2.4;
those four are registered alongside the other string functions in
`string_functions()` and implemented in `functions/host_port.rs`. Some per-type
overloads use generic `T1` signatures where the specification spells out per concrete
type (e.g., `repr_pwsh` has separate signatures for string, int, float, bool, path,
range_expr, list in the spec but uses generic `T1` in Rust).

## Function Semantics

Individual function behaviors (arithmetic semantics, string methods, regex restrictions,
path operations, etc.) are defined in the
[OpenJD Expression Language specification](https://github.com/OpenJobDescription/openjd-specifications/wiki/2026-02-Expression-Language),
sections 2.1 (Operators) and 2.2 (Built-in Functions). Key implementation choices:

- **Integer arithmetic** uses Python-style floored division and modulo (§2.1.1)
- **Float modulo** starts from the truncating floating-point remainder and corrects
  its sign to match the divisor. It does not reconstruct the remainder from a rounded
  quotient, which would lose precision for large quotients.
- **Float floor division** derives its quotient from that remainder before rounding
  toward negative infinity. This avoids flooring an already-rounded direct quotient.
- **`round()`** uses banker's rounding / round-half-even (§2.2.2)
- **String classification** (`isdigit`, `isalpha`, `isalnum`, `isspace`,
  `isupper`, `islower`, §2.2.4) matches Python's `str` methods of the same
  name exactly, not Rust's `char` predicates, which use different Unicode
  properties (e.g. `char::is_alphabetic()` is the `Alphabetic` property, a
  superset of Python's `L*` categories; `char::is_ascii_digit()` misses
  non-ASCII decimal digits). Lookup tables in
  `functions/unicode_tables.rs` are generated from CPython by
  `scripts/generate_unicode_tables.py` and pinned to a stated Unicode
  version (see `UNICODE_VERSION` in the generated file). `isupper`/`islower`
  follow Python's cased-character rule: at least one cased character and
  every cased character upper/lowercase — uncased characters (digits, CJK)
  are ignored, and titlecase (Lt) characters are cased but neither upper
  nor lower. Regenerate the tables with the script when intentionally
  adopting a newer Unicode version.
- **Whitespace trimming and splitting** (§2.2.4): `strip()`/`lstrip()`/
  `rstrip()` without a `chars` argument and no-separator `split()`/
  `rsplit()` trim and split on CPython's `Py_UNICODE_ISSPACE` set via the
  same `SPACE` table as `isspace()` — Unicode `White_Space` plus the
  information separators U+001C..U+001F, which Rust's
  `str::trim`/`split_whitespace` (exactly `White_Space`) would miss.
  The `int(string)`/`float(string)` conversions deliberately keep Rust's
  `str::trim` instead: CPython's `int()`/`float()` accept `White_Space`
  around the number but reject U+001C..U+001F (`int('\x1c5')` raises even
  though `isspace('\x1c')` is `true`), so `White_Space` is the
  CPython-exact set there.
- **`int(string)` and `float(string)`** (§2.2.1) accept Unicode decimal
  digits, matching CPython: characters with `Numeric_Type=Decimal` (general
  category Nd, e.g. `'٣'` U+0663) are replaced with their ASCII values
  before parsing, via `decimal_digit_value()` backed by the generated
  `DECIMAL` table. This keeps the guard pattern
  `int(Param.X) if isdigit(Param.X) else 0` sound for Nd digits.
  `Numeric_Type=Digit` characters like `'²'` remain errors — `isdigit('²')`
  is `true` but `int('²')` fails, exactly as in CPython. Two deliberate
  differences from CPython remain: underscores between digits are rejected
  (`int('1_0')` is an error here, `10` in CPython) because expression
  strings come from template data where `'1_0'` is more likely a mistake
  than a readability separator, and the implicit string→int/float coercion
  of format-string results and parameter values (`ExprValue::from_str_coerce`)
  stays ASCII-only.
- **`title()` and `capitalize()`** (§2.2.4) also match Python exactly.
  `title()` follows CPython's `do_title`: a character is titlecased when the
  previous character is not cased, lowercased otherwise — so digits and
  other uncased characters restart words (`'1st'` → `'1St'`). Word-start
  characters use the full titlecase mapping (`TITLE_MAP`, ToTitleFull):
  the dz-digraph U+01C6 titlecases to U+01C5 (not uppercase U+01C4), and
  `ß` expands to `Ss`. `capitalize()` titlecases the first character (Python
  ≥ 3.8 semantics) and lowercases the rest. Both apply the Final_Sigma
  context rule when lowering U+03A3 (via the `CASED` and `CASE_IGNORABLE`
  tables), which Rust's context-free `char::to_lowercase` cannot express.
- **Host and port functions** (`join_host_port`, `split_host_port`, `is_ipv4`,
  `is_ipv6`, §2.2.4; added by RFC 0009) follow Go's `net.JoinHostPort` and
  `net.SplitHostPort` with the two deviations the spec requires. `join_host_port`
  brackets the host when it contains a colon and is not already wrapped in a
  matching `[`…`]` pair, so `"[2001:db8::5]"` is not bracketed again; the port is
  formatted from its `int` value without range validation; a `%zone` suffix is
  carried through verbatim. `split_host_port` finds the port after the *last*
  colon. It returns `null` (not an error) when there is no port: no colon at all,
  a `[host]` with nothing after `]`, or an unbracketed host containing more than
  one colon (a bare IPv6 literal). Malformed brackets are an evaluation error whose
  message quotes the input: a `[` with no `]` (`missing ']'`), characters between
  `]` and the port's `:` (`unexpected characters after ']'`), a `]:` followed by a
  further colon (`too many colons`), or a `[`/`]` anywhere else
  (`unexpected '[' or ']'`). Brackets are stripped from the returned host, the
  port element is returned as an unvalidated string (so `"host:"` splits to
  `["host", ""]` as in Go), and the result list is `list[string]`; the signature's
  `list[string]?` return type makes `split_host_port(S)` with an unresolved `S`
  evaluate to `unresolved[list[string]?]`. `is_ipv4` is `std::net::Ipv4Addr`
  parsing (dotted quad only; leading-zero octets are rejected). `is_ipv6` strips
  one matching pair of brackets and a non-empty `%zone` suffix, then uses
  `std::net::Ipv6Addr` parsing, so `"::1"`, `"[::1]"`, `"fe80::1%eth0"` and
  `"[fe80::1%eth0]"` are all `true` while `"[::1]:80"` and `"fe80::1%"` are
  `false`. All four count string operations proportional to the input length;
  `join_host_port` reserves its output budget before formatting and
  `split_host_port` builds its list through `make_list_checked`.
- **Regex functions** reject lookahead, lookbehind, backreferences, and `\Z` (§2.2.5).
  Validation parses the pattern with `regex_syntax`, rather than a substring
  scan. This correctly ignores lookaround-shaped syntax that appears inside
  character classes, escaped sequences, or regex comments (e.g., `[(?=]`,
  `\?=`, `(?#...)`). The parser rejects forbidden constructs at parse time;
  the translated error names the specific feature (e.g., "Unsupported regex
  feature: lookahead") so callers can produce stable diagnostics.
  Validation walks the pattern's **AST** (not just its HIR) because several
  Rust-only constructs outside the spec's Python/Rust intersection dialect
  are erased by AST→HIR translation and must be rejected at the AST level:
  Unicode property classes (`\p{...}`/`\P{...}`), the `(?<name>...)` capture
  group spelling (Python requires `(?P<name>...)`), capture group names
  that are not valid Python identifiers — checked against the
  `IDENT_START`/`IDENT_CONTINUE` tables generated from CPython's
  `str.isidentifier()` (XID_Start/XID_Continue plus `_`), matching the
  exact rule `sre_parse` applies; `regex_syntax` is more permissive,
  allowing `.`, `[`, `]` and any `char::is_alphanumeric` character (e.g.
  `²`, category No, which is not XID_Continue), where Python raises "bad
  character in group name" — POSIX character
  classes (`[[:alpha:]]`), character class set operators (`--`, `&&`,
  `~~`), nested character classes (`[a[b]]`), Rust-only inline flags (`U`
  swap greed, `R` CRLF mode, negated `u`, and bare global negation
  `(?-...)`; the shared flags `i`, `m`, `s`, `x` and positive `u` remain
  allowed, including scoped negation `(?-i:...)`), bare inline flags
  anywhere but the start of the pattern (`a(?i)b` — an error in Python
  3.11+, applied globally rather than forward-only in older Pythons;
  consecutive leading flag groups stay allowed), verbose mode combined with
  unescaped whitespace or `#` inside a character class (`(?x)[a b]` — Rust
  strips them, Python VERBOSE keeps them as literals), and Rust-only word
  boundary spellings (`\b{start}`, `\b{end}`, `\b{start-half}`,
  `\b{end-half}`, `\<`, `\>` — Python reads these as `\b` plus literal
  characters, silently diverging). The AST is then translated to HIR for a
  belt-and-braces walk over the remaining constructs.
  **Known accepted divergence:** plain `$` without MULTILINE matches before
  a trailing newline in Python but is end-of-haystack only in Rust
  (Python's `$` ≈ Rust's `(?:\n?\z)`); the intersection dialect allows `$`,
  so results differ on newline-terminated input.
- **`repr_sh/cmd/pwsh`** produce shell-safe quoting per platform conventions (§2.2.6).
  `repr_pwsh` renders nested lists as nested array literals, using the unary
  comma for a one-element outer list (`@(,@(1, 2))`) since `@(@(1, 2))`
  flattens in PowerShell. `repr_sh` and `repr_cmd` reject nested lists at
  signature dispatch.
- **Path operations** are format-aware (POSIX/Windows/URI) without using `std::path` (§2.3)
- **`path(list[string])` constructor** follows Python `PurePosixPath(*parts)` /
  `PureWindowsPath(*parts)` semantics: an absolute component in the list resets the
  accumulator (discarding earlier components), empty strings are ignored, `.` segments
  are removed, duplicate separators are collapsed, and `..` is preserved without
  resolution. For Windows, drive letters and UNC prefixes follow pathlib's rules:
  a different drive replaces everything, a root-only component replaces from root
  while keeping the existing drive, and a same-drive relative component appends.
- **Slicing a `range_expr`** returns `range_expr` for positive step, `list[int]` for
  negative step (§2.1.8)
