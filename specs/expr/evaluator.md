# Evaluator

## Overview

The evaluator is an AST-walking interpreter that evaluates parsed EXPR expressions
against a symbol table, using the function library for dispatch. It tracks memory and
operation counts to enforce resource bounds.

Defined in `eval/evaluator.rs`. The central `evaluate_inner` method is a dispatch
table mapping each AST node type to a dedicated `eval_*` method. Child evaluators
(used by list comprehensions) are created via `child_evaluator()` with resource
counters propagated back via `absorb_counters()`.

## Builder Pattern

Evaluation is configured through builder methods on `ParsedExpression`:

```rust
let parsed = ParsedExpression::new("Param.Frame * 2 + 1")?;

// Simple — defaults for everything
let value = parsed.evaluate(&symtab)?;

// Configured — custom limits, path format, library
let result = parsed
    .with_library(&custom_lib)
    .with_memory_limit(50_000_000)
    .with_operation_limit(1_000_000)
    .with_path_format(PathFormat::Posix)
    .evaluate(&[&symtab])?;

// Configured, with resource-usage metrics
let result = parsed
    .with_memory_limit(50_000_000)
    .evaluate_with_metrics(&[&symtab])?;
println!("Value: {:?}", result.value);
println!("Peak memory: {} bytes", result.peak_memory);
println!("Operations: {}", result.operation_count);
```

Calling any `with_*` method on `ParsedExpression` produces a
`EvalBuilder<'_>` that borrows the parsed expression and captures
configuration. Subsequent `with_*` calls chain on the builder. The terminal
`.evaluate(&symtabs)` takes the symbol tables as an argument and runs the
internal evaluator; `.evaluate_with_metrics(&symtabs)` additionally returns
peak memory and operation count in an `EvalResult`.

Path mapping rules are **not** an evaluator configuration. They are state owned
by the `apply_path_mapping` implementation, which is a closure registered on the
function library when that library is built with
[`FunctionLibrary::for_profile`](function-library.md#for_profile) against an
[`ExprProfile`](../../crates/openjd-expr/src/profile.rs) whose `host_context` is
`HostContext::WithRules(...)`. The evaluator just calls functions; it has no
direct awareness of mapping rules.

Builder methods on `EvalBuilder` (also available as shortcut
methods on `ParsedExpression`):

| Method | Default | Purpose | Notes |
|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| `with_library(&FunctionLibrary)` | `FunctionLibrary::for_profile(&ExprProfile::current())` | Custom function library | Add host-context functions or restrict operations |
| `with_memory_limit(usize)` | 100,000,000 (100 MB) | Memory bound | Tracks all intermediate values; returns `MemoryLimitExceeded` |
| `with_operation_limit(usize)` | 10,000,000 (10M) | Operation bound | Each call=1, list iteration=N, string ops=ceil(len/256) |
| `with_path_format(PathFormat)` | Host native | Path normalization format | Also validates that `Path` values in symbol table match |
| `with_target_type(&ExprType)` | None | Final-result coercion + per-node hint | Operators evaluate operands unconstrained per RFC 0005 (see [Target Type Propagation](#target-type-propagation)) |

The underlying `Evaluator` struct is crate-private. Keyword renames and
expression source text for error messages are wired up automatically by
`EvalBuilder` using fields already on `ParsedExpression`, so
downstream callers never have to set them.

## Resource Bounding

### Memory Tracking

Every `ExprValue` created during evaluation is tracked:

```
create value → _track(value)     → current_memory += value.memory_size()
                                   peak_memory = max(peak_memory, current_memory)
                                   if current_memory > limit → error

consume value → _release(value)  → current_memory -= value.memory_size()
```

The `dispatch` method centralizes this: it releases input values, calls the function
implementation, and tracks the output value. This keeps function implementations pure
(values in, value out) with memory tracking handled by the evaluator.

### Operation Counting

Every function call increments the operation counter:

| Operation | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Function/operator call | 1 |
| List iteration (comprehension, sorted, etc.) | +N (element count) |
| String processing | +ceil(len / 256) |

The proportional costs prevent DoS via large strings or lists — a million-element list
comprehension costs 1M operations even if each iteration is trivial.

A call's own operation is charged *after* its arguments are evaluated,
immediately before dispatch — matching the Python reference's
`_call_function`. This affects which node a limit error is attributed
to: in `any([False] * 1000)` with a limit of 100, the multiplication's
batch charge (1001 total) trips the limit and the error points at the
`*` expression, not the enclosing `any()` call.

Functions that produce output proportional to an argument value batch
their charges up front with `count_ops(n)`/`count_string_ops(len)`
using *checked* size arithmetic, so oversized repeat counts (e.g.
`'abcd' * 2^62`) surface as integer-overflow errors rather than
wrapped-length budget bypasses, and repeat/padding outputs are also
checked against the memory budget before their final allocation.
Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, …) and the `repr_*` functions
charge one operation per list element (`max(len_a, len_b)` for
comparisons, *before* the length check — matching the Python
reference, where comparing against a large `range_expr` materializes
it). Note that these guarantees are per-function-final-output:
intermediate allocations (e.g. split's part vectors) may still occur
before a final `make_list_checked`-style check, bounded by the
input-proportional operation charges.

### Depth Limit

In addition to memory and operation counters, the evaluator carries a
`recursion_depth: usize` field that is incremented on every call to
`Evaluator::evaluate` and decremented on return. If the counter exceeds
[`MAX_EXPRESSION_DEPTH`](../../crates/openjd-expr/src/eval/parse.rs) (currently
**64**), evaluation fails with `ExpressionErrorKind::ExpressionTooDeep`.

The evaluator's depth guard catches deep ASTs that slipped past the parse-phase
check — notably long left-associative binop chains like `1+1+1+...+1`, which
the parser-side source prefix scan does **not** flag (the source has no
consecutive `(`/`-` tokens) but which produce a left-leaning BinOp tree of
O(N) height. Without this guard, such inputs recurse through the `eval_binop`
→ `evaluate(&b.left)` chain until the thread's stack overflows and the process
aborts (`std::panic::catch_unwind` cannot recover from a stack overflow).

Child evaluators created for list comprehensions inherit the parent's
`recursion_depth`, so nested comprehensions share the same budget rather than
each having a fresh 64-level allowance.

See also [parser.md § Depth Limit](parser.md#depth-limit) for the source-level
and AST-walker checks that complement this evaluator-side guard.

## Target Type Propagation

The optional `target_type` set via `EvalBuilder::with_target_type` shapes
**two** things:

1. **Per-node hints** — selected nodes use the live target type to choose
   between equally-valid behaviors (e.g., `eval_list` infers the element
   type for an empty list literal `[]` from a `list[T]` target).
2. **Final-result coercion** — after the root node evaluates, the
   `evaluate()` wrapper coerces the value toward the target type via
   [`ExprValue::coerce`](values.md#coerce). With no target type set, this
   step is a no-op.

The propagation rules below come from [RFC 0005 §"Target Type Propagation
Rules"](https://github.com/OpenJobDescription/openjd-specifications/blob/main/rfcs/0005-expression-language.md#expression-evaluation):

| Node | Target type seen by children |
|------|------------------------------|
| `BinOp` (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`) | Both operands: `None` (unconstrained) |
| `UnaryOp` (`-x`, `+x`, `not x`) | Operand: `None` (unconstrained) |
| `Compare` (`<`, `>`, `==`, `in`, …) | All operands: `None` (unconstrained) |
| `IfExp` (`x if c else y`) | `test`: `None`; `body` / `orelse`: parent target |
| `BoolOp` (`and`, `or`) | All operands: parent target (value-returning, see RFC 0006) |
| `Call` | Arguments: parent target (signature-driven coercion happens inside `dispatch`) |
| `List` | Elements: element type extracted from `list[T]` parent target |
| `ListComp` | Element expr: element type from parent; iter: parent; conditions: parent |
| `Subscript` | Value: parent; index/slice: parent |
| `Attribute` / `Name` / `Constant` | N/A (leaf) |

The "unconstrained" rule for `BinOp` / `UnaryOp` / `Compare` is the load-bearing
piece: it stops a `target_type=string` request from collapsing
`Param.Count - 1` into `"100" - "1"` and erroring out — instead, both
operands evaluate as integers, `__sub__` runs in integer land, and the
final coercion converts the resulting `Int(99)` into `String("99")`.
RFC 0005 calls this out by name in its rationale, with the exact same
example.

This is currently realized via a single
`Evaluator::evaluate_with_target(node, target)` helper that swaps the
field for the duration of one recursive call, then restores the saved
value. Operators that need to clear the target call it with `None`;
`eval_list` uses the same primitive (open-coded) to push the element
type down.

The `IfExp.test` slot is a per-node `None` rather than `Some(BOOL)`.
Pushing `BOOL` would invoke `coerce` on the test result, and that path
loses the friendlier "Condition must be a boolean, got X" message
that `eval_ifexp` produces from its explicit type check. Because the
explicit check enforces bool-ness, the unconstrained recursion is
strictly better for diagnostics.

## AST Node Evaluation

The evaluator dispatches on AST node type:

### Constant (`eval_constant`)
Converts Python literals to `ExprValue`. Preserves the original string representation
for float literals (e.g., `3.14` stores both the f64 and `"3.14"`) for lossless
round-tripping.

### Name (`eval_name`)
Looks up a simple name in the symbol tables (searched in order). Also handles JSON
literal normalization (`null`, `true`, `false`) and comprehension loop variables.

### Attribute (`eval_attribute`)
Handles dotted access like `Param.Frame` or `path.name`. Resolution order:

1. Try the full dotted path as a variable lookup (e.g., `Param.Frame` in symbol table)
2. Try progressively shorter prefixes as variable lookups, with the remainder as
   property access (e.g., look up `Param`, then access `.Frame` as a property)
3. If the base is a value, dispatch to `__property_NAME__` in the function library

This dual-purpose resolution is why `Param.Frame` works as a variable lookup and
`my_path.name` works as a property access, using the same syntax.

### Operator dispatch table (`eval/op_table.rs`)

The mapping from Python AST operators to dunder function names — and the
gate list of unsupported operators (bitwise ops, shifts, `@`, `~`, `is`,
`is not`) — lives in a single `OperatorTable` type in `eval/op_table.rs`.
Each operator maps to either a dunder name (`OpSpec::Dunder` /
`CmpOpSpec::Dispatch`) or a gate (`OpSpec::Gated` / `CmpOpSpec::Gated`)
pairing the `SyntaxFeature` that would enable it with its rejection
message. The table has two consumers:

- **Parse time** — `validate_structure` in `eval/parse.rs` consults the
  `*_spec` lookups together with the profile: a gated operator is rejected
  unless `ExprProfile::allows_syntax` grants its feature. This is the
  profile-aware gate and the layer that rejects gated operators today.
- **Eval time** — `eval_binop`, `eval_unaryop`, and `eval_compare` consult
  the `Result`-returning lookups (`binop`/`unaryop`/`cmpop`), which reject
  gated operators unconditionally. The evaluator holds no profile; these
  arms are a defense-in-depth backstop behind the parse gate. When an
  extension first grants an operator feature, the evaluator additionally
  needs profile plumbing (e.g. a table derived from the `FunctionLibrary`)
  and a registered dunder for the operator.

Because both layers read the same table, a future revision or extension
that adds, removes, or remaps an operator changes one table, and the
parse-time and eval-time error messages cannot drift apart. The lookup
matches are exhaustive without wildcards, so a new operator variant
introduced by a `ruff_python_ast` upgrade is a compile error in one file.
Today there is a single baseline table shared by all profiles.

### BinOp (`eval_binop`)
Maps Python operators to dunder function names (via the operator table)
and dispatches through the library:

```
a + b  → __add__(a, b)
a - b  → __sub__(a, b)
a * b  → __mul__(a, b)
a / b  → __truediv__(a, b)
a // b → __floordiv__(a, b)
a % b  → __mod__(a, b)
a ** b → __pow__(a, b)
```

Both operands are evaluated **unconstrained** (per [Target Type
Propagation](#target-type-propagation)), then `dispatch` handles memory
release/track.

### UnaryOp (`eval_unaryop`)
Maps to `__neg__`, `__pos__`, `__not__`. The single operand is evaluated
unconstrained.

Special case: `-<int literal>` is folded into a single negative integer to handle
`INT64_MIN` (-2^63), which cannot be represented as a negated positive literal.

### Compare (`eval_compare`)
Supports chained comparisons (`1 < x < 10`). Maps operators:

```
==  → __eq__       !=  → __ne__
<   → __lt__       <=  → __le__
>   → __gt__       >=  → __ge__
in  → __contains__(container, item)    # note: args swapped
not in → __not_contains__(container, item)
```

Chained comparisons short-circuit: `a < b < c` evaluates `a < b`, and only if true,
evaluates `b < c`. The intermediate value `b` is reused. All comparison operands
are evaluated unconstrained (see [Target Type
Propagation](#target-type-propagation)).

Comparison stays in the evaluator (not fully delegated to the library) because the
chaining logic requires control flow that doesn't fit the simple dispatch model.

#### Chained Comparison Memory Management

Each comparison in the chain clones `left` and `right` to pass to `dispatch` (which
releases its inputs), while retaining the originals for the chain. After dispatch
returns, the boolean result is extracted and the dispatch return value is released.
If the comparison is false, both `left` and `right` are released and `false` is returned
immediately (short-circuit). If true, `left` is released and `right` becomes the new
`left` for the next iteration — avoiding a redundant re-evaluation of the shared
operand. After the final comparison, the surviving `left` is released and `true` is
returned.

```
a < b < c
  │
  ├── left = eval(a), right = eval(b)
  ├── dispatch("__lt__", [left.clone(), right.clone()])
  ├── result true → release(left), left = right
  │
  ├── right = eval(c)
  ├── dispatch("__lt__", [left.clone(), right.clone()])
  ├── result true → release(left), release(right)
  └── return true
```

The clone-and-release pattern is necessary because `dispatch` consumes (releases) its
arguments for memory tracking, but the chained comparison needs to retain the shared
middle operand for the next pair.

### BoolOp (`eval_boolop`)
`and` and `or` are value-returning with null-coalescing semantics:

- `a and b` → returns `a` if falsy, else `b`
- `a or b` → returns `a` if truthy, else `b`

**Falsy definition:** In the OpenJD expression language, only `null` and `false` are
falsy. `0`, `""`, `[]`, and all other values are truthy. This narrower definition
differs from Python (where `0`, `""`, `[]`, and `None` are all falsy) and was chosen
because treating empty strings and zero as falsy is a common source of bugs in
template expressions — `Param.Name or "default"` should only fall through to the
default when the parameter is genuinely absent (null), not when it happens to be
an empty string.

This enables null-coalescing patterns like `Param.X or "default"` while still
letting `Param.Flag or true` yield `true` when the flag is `false`.

When an earlier operand is unresolved, subsequent operands are still evaluated (to
catch type errors in them), but the final result is `Unresolved(BOOL)` unless a
subsequent concrete operand proves the result by short-circuiting (e.g.,
`Unresolved and false` returns `false`). Errors in operands past the unresolved one
are suppressed, since a runtime short-circuit could make them unreachable.

### IfExp (`eval_ifexp`)
Ternary: `x if condition else y`. Evaluates the condition unconstrained
(see [Target Type Propagation](#target-type-propagation)) and asserts it
is bool-compatible, then evaluates only the selected branch with the
parent target type. When the condition is unresolved, both branches are
evaluated and the result type is the union.

### Call (`eval_call`)
Handles both function calls (`len(x)`) and method calls (`x.upper()`).

Method calls are transformed to function calls via UFCS (Uniform Function Call Syntax):
`obj.method(args)` → `method(obj, args)`.

Rejects:
- Direct dunder calls (`__add__(1, 2)` — use `1 + 2` instead)
- Calling properties as methods (`path.name()` — use `path.name` instead)

### List (`eval_list`)
Evaluates list literals. Validates max 2 nesting levels. Coerces elements when mixed
types are present (int→float, path→string). Empty lists use the target type context
to determine element type.

### ListComp (`eval_listcomp`)
Evaluates list comprehensions: `[expr for var in iterable if condition]`.

- Single generator only (no nested `for` clauses)
- Creates a local scope per iteration (loop variable doesn't leak)
- Handles unresolved iterables by evaluating the body once with an unresolved loop variable
- Operation count: +1 per iteration

### Subscript (`eval_subscript`)
Handles indexing (`x[0]`) and slicing (`x[1:3]`, `x[::2]`).

- Negative indices wrap around (Python semantics)
- Slices return the same type as the input (string→string, list→list)
- Out-of-bounds index raises an error; out-of-bounds slice clamps silently

## Dispatch Flow

The `dispatch` method is the centralized point for calling library functions:

```
dispatch(name, args, ast_node)
    │
    ├── Release input values from memory tracking
    │
    ├── Check if any arg is unresolved
    │   └── Yes → infer return type from signature, return Unresolved(return_type)
    │
    ├── Call library.call(name, args, eval_context)
    │   │
    │   ├── Phase 1: Exact non-generic match
    │   ├── Phase 2: Non-generic with coercion (skip receiver coercion for methods)
    │   └── Phase 3: Generic match with type variable binding
    │
    ├── Track output value in memory
    │
    └── On error: attach AST node context for caret formatting
```

## Fast Path: Simple Name Lookup

`ParsedExpression::as_name_lookup()` detects expressions that are just a dotted name
(e.g., `Param.Frame`) and returns the name string directly. This bypasses full evaluation
for simple variable substitution, which is the common case for base-spec format strings.

Note that `as_name_lookup` returns the raw dotted name without interpreting it — for
`Param.OutputDir.name` it returns `"Param.OutputDir.name"`, and the caller must determine
that `"Param.OutputDir"` is the symbol table entry and `"name"` is a property access on
it. Most callers will want to use regular evaluation instead; this fast path is primarily
for letting implementations validate templates correctly without EXPR enabled, where
expressions must be simple dotted name lookups.

## Regex Cache

The evaluator maintains a `HashMap<String, regex::Regex>` that caches compiled regex
patterns across function calls within a single evaluation. When a regex function
(`re_match`, `re_search`, `re_sub`) is called, the evaluator checks the cache
before compiling. This avoids recompiling the same pattern when used multiple times,
e.g., in a list comprehension like `[x for x in items if re_search(x, "shot") != null]`.

The cache is per-evaluation, not global — it is created fresh for each `evaluate()` call
and discarded afterward. Child evaluators (created for list comprehensions) share the
parent's cache via move-and-return: the parent's cache is moved into the child before
each iteration and moved back after, so patterns compiled in one iteration are available
in subsequent iterations without recompilation.

## Divergence from Python

The Rust evaluator uses the same algorithmic structure as the Python `Evaluator` class.
Key differences:

1. **Builder pattern** — Python uses constructor arguments; Rust uses a builder for
   clearer configuration.
2. **Centralized dispatch** — The Rust `dispatch` method handles memory release/track
   around every function call. Python does this inline in each eval method.
3. **EvalContext trait** — Function implementations access evaluator state through the
   `EvalContext` trait rather than receiving the evaluator directly. This prevents
   function implementations from calling evaluation methods, enforcing the separation
   between evaluation control flow and function logic.
4. **Typed list variants** — The evaluator constructs typed list variants directly,
   avoiding the overhead of wrapping each element in a tagged `ExprValue`.
