# Job Creation Pipeline

The `create_job` module transforms parsed templates into instantiated jobs. This is the core
workflow: templates + user-provided parameter values → a `job::Job` ready for session execution.

## Public API

### merge_job_parameter_definitions

```rust
pub fn merge_job_parameter_definitions(
    job_template: &JobTemplate,
    environment_templates: &[EnvironmentTemplate],
) -> Result<Vec<MergedParameterDefinition>, ModelError>
```

Merges parameter definitions from environment templates (processed in order) then the job
template (last), per §1.2.1.

Environment templates and job templates share the same parameter namespace. This allows an
environment template to accept a parameter that defines, for example, which software
installation to provide, while the job template defines that parameter's default value for
the software the job needs. The merge rules accommodate this and similar use cases where
multiple templates collaborate on the same parameters.

Returns a list of `MergedParameterDefinition` entries, each containing the merged definition
and its source template.

**Merge rules:**
- All definitions of the same parameter must have the same type
- `allowedValues`: intersection (must be non-empty after intersection)
- `minLength`/`minValue`: takes the maximum (most restrictive)
- `maxLength`/`maxValue`: takes the minimum (most restrictive)
- PATH-specific: `objectType` and `dataFlow` must be identical across definitions
- Default value: last template to define one wins

Conflicts produce `ModelError::Compatibility` with details about which templates conflict.

### preprocess_job_parameters

```rust
pub fn preprocess_job_parameters(
    job_template: &JobTemplate,
    input_values: &JobParameterInputValues,
    environment_templates: &[EnvironmentTemplate],
    path_options: &PathParameterOptions<'_>,
) -> Result<JobParameterValues, ModelError>
```

Validates and coerces user-provided parameter values against merged definitions.

`PathParameterOptions` consolidates path-related options:

```rust
pub struct PathParameterOptions<'a> {
    pub job_template_dir: &'a Path,
    pub current_working_dir: &'a Path,
    pub allow_template_dir_walk_up: bool,
    pub path_format: PathFormat,
    pub allow_uri_path_values: bool,
}
```

**Pipeline:**
1. Merge parameter definitions from all templates
2. Check for extra (undefined) parameters in input
3. Fill defaults for missing parameters
4. Coerce values to target types
5. Validate PATH parameters (relative path resolution, URI handling)
6. Check constraints (allowedValues, min/max, length bounds)
7. Validate merged constraints across multiple definitions
8. Error on still-missing required parameters

**PATH handling:**
- User-provided relative paths joined to `current_working_dir`
- Default relative paths joined to `job_template_dir`
- URI paths (`s3://`, `https://`) preserved as-is when EXPR extension is enabled
- `allow_template_dir_walk_up` controls whether paths can traverse above `job_template_dir`. When `false`, a default is rejected unless its normalized form is `job_template_dir` itself or a descendant. Containment is checked per path component, not by raw string prefix.

**Value coercion:**
- `coerce_from_str` — Parses string input (CLI): numeric parsing, boolean aliases
  (`yes`/`no`/`on`/`off`/`1`/`0`), JSON list parsing for list types
- `coerce_to_job_parameter_type` — Validates typed input (library): type compatibility, numeric
  widening (int → float), list element type validation

**Round trip:** a value `preprocess_job_parameters` returns should be a value it accepts as input.
Both its input and output types are public, so a caller can hand its output straight back to it.
`create_job` relies on something adjacent for every caller: it re-runs `check_constraints` over each
value it is given (`create_job/mod.rs:54`-`:59`).

A goal rather than an established invariant. One case is known to violate it: a scalar `PATH` with a
**relative** default plus a `maxLength`, `minLength` or `allowedValues` constraint. The first pass joins
the default to `job_template_dir` and does not constrain-check a default, while the second pass receives
the joined absolute path as submitted input and measures the constraint against it. Measured, a relative
default of `out` under `maxLength: 8` reports `value length 72 exceeds maximum 8` on the second pass.

For lists it holds by construction, because **a job parameter stores a path as a string.** A path is
context-sensitive: the same value does not denote the same file on a Windows submitter and a Linux
worker, and job parameters are settled before there is a host to ask. OpenJD keeps paths POSIX until
template evaluation on the host -- every `with_path_format` call in this crate passes
`PathFormat::Posix`, and `openjd-sessions` passes `PathFormat::host()` -- and stores `PATH` and
`LIST[PATH]` parameter values as strings. `build_symbol_table` does not bind `Param.*` for those two
types at all, for the same reason.

So a `LIST[PATH]` value is an `ExprValue::ListString` at every length, and `ExprValue::ListPath`, which
carries a `PathFormat`, is not a shape a stored parameter value has. It is refused as input at any
length. An empty list is where that could drift, having no elements to infer a variant from:
`coerce_json_to_job_parameter_type` types it from a hint, and the hint must name `STRING`, the variant
the coerced elements produce, rather than the declared `PATH`. Passing `PATH` gave the empty case a
`ListPath` that `openjd-sessions::build_symbol_table` then dropped, leaving `Param.<name>` unbound at
session scope (issue #387). That was issue #389.

### build_symbol_table

```rust
pub fn build_symbol_table(
    params: &JobParameterValues,
) -> Result<SymbolTable, ModelError>
```

Builds a `SymbolTable` with `Param.*` and `RawParam.*` entries from processed parameter
values. Returns `Result` because symbol table insertion can fail.

PATH types are stored as `Unresolved(PATH)` since the source path format may differ
from the host path format — the value must be preserved exactly as a string until path
mapping is applied at session time. `RawParam.*` for PATH types is forced to STRING.

### create_job

```rust
pub fn create_job(
    job_template: &JobTemplate,
    job_parameter_values: &JobParameterValues,
    ctx: &ValidationContext,
) -> Result<job::Job, ModelError>
```

Full template instantiation pipeline. Environment templates should
already be merged into `job_parameter_values` via `preprocess_job_parameters` before
calling this function. `ctx` carries the model profile and the
`CallerLimits` that apply to this job instance — typically the same
context the template was decoded with, but a caller may deliberately
pass a different one (e.g. stricter queue-level limits).

Every expression evaluation this stage performs — the job name, host
requirement values, parameter-space ranges, `let` bindings, and the
carried-forward checks below — runs under the caller's evaluation budgets
(`CallerLimits::max_eval_memory_bytes` / `max_eval_operations`,
defaults: the Expression Language spec's 100 MB / 10 M), the same
budgets template validation and the session runtime apply.

1. Build symbol table from parameter values
2. Resolve template-scope fields:
   - Job name (evaluate FormatString). The resolved name is checked against §1.1.1:
     length vs `max_job_name_len`, non-empty, and no Cc control characters. Decode
     already rejects an empty literal name, control characters in the name's literal
     text (verbatim in every resolution), and a fully static name resolving to an
     empty or control-character-bearing value — what remains only knowable here is
     an emptiness or control character *introduced by an interpolated value*.
   - Step names
   - Host requirement values (amounts min/max, attribute values). Resolved amount bounds
     must be finite `f64` values; non-numeric, NaN, and infinite results are rejected.
     Resolved `attributes[].anyOf` / `.allOf` elements are re-checked against
     `<AttributeCapabilityValue>` (§3.3.2.2) via
     `capabilities::validate_attribute_capability_value`, because decode skips that check
     when the element is a format string. Errors are reported at
     `steps[i] -> hostRequirements -> attributes[j] -> anyOf[k]` so they read like the
     decode-time error for a literal value. Only the first failing `anyOf`/`allOf` group on
     the first failing attribute is reported; decode accumulates every violation instead.
     The amount bound constraints (`min` non-negative, `max` positive, `min <= max`) are
     re-applied on the resolved value by `check_resolved_amount_bounds`, and the
     `chunks.defaultTaskCount` / `targetRuntimeSeconds` minimums are re-applied by
     `resolve_parameter_space` — see [validation.md](validation.md). Chunks fields
     resolve single whole-field expressions with the target type Expression Language
     §1.3.2 derives from the schema: `int` for the required `defaultTaskCount`
     (so `{{ 4.0 }}` coerces to 4) and `int?` for the optional
     `targetRuntimeSeconds` (a whole-field `null` means the field is omitted);
     multi-segment strings concatenate and parse with surrounding whitespace
     tolerated.
   - Parameter space ranges (evaluate range expressions, resolve FormatString ranges).
     STRING/PATH range elements are list items (Expression Language §1.3.2): a
     whole-field expression targets `string? | list[string]`, so `null` skips the
     element and a list flattens inline — one range element per list element,
     mixable with literal elements. A range emptied by null-skips is rejected
     ("has no elements after resolution"), since the ≥1-element rule was checked
     on field presence at decode. Attribute `anyOf`/`allOf` values get the same
     treatment in `instantiate`. String-backed FLOAT range elements are trimmed
     and must resolve to finite `f64` values.
   - Step-level let bindings
3. With EXPR extension: inject `Job.Name` (before step instantiation)
   and `Step.Name` (per step) into the symbol table
4. Carry forward session/task-scope fields as FormatString (plus action
   `timeout`/`notifyPeriodInSeconds`, which validate in template scope but
   resolve on the worker)
5. Run the resolved-value checks on the carried-forward fields
   (next section)
6. Convert environments from template to job types
7. Build step dependency list
8. Attach resolved symbol table to each step

#### Resolved-value checks on carried-forward fields

Of the spec's three processing stages (Template Schemas §7.4: template
validation, job creation, task execution on the worker host), job
creation is the first at which job parameters have real values. The
session/task-scope format strings it carries forward unresolved —
action `command`/`args`, environment `variables` values, embedded-file
`data` — are statically evaluated against a **check symbol table**, and
exactly the resolved-value checks pass 8 applies to those fields re-run
on the result:

| Field | Constraint |
|---|---|
| environment `variables` values | resolved-length bound vs 2048 (§4.4.2, spec-mandated, always on) |
| action `command`, each `args[*]` entry | bound vs `CallerLimits::max_resolved_arg_len`, if set |
| embedded file `data` | bound vs `CallerLimits::max_resolved_data_len`, if set |

At template validation every `Param.*` is unresolved and contributes 0
to the lower bound; here the parameters are bound to real values, so a
violation that depends only on parameter values —
`args: ["{{ 'A' * Param.N }}"]` submitted with a huge `N` — becomes
decidable and fails at submission instead of on every worker (task
execution remains the enforcement boundary). The
walk covers step scripts (`onRun` + embedded files), step environments,
and job environments — including the RFC 0008 wrap hooks, with their
`WrappedAction.*` scopes seeded unresolved, exactly as in pass 8. A
SimpleAction step is checked through its **sugar fields** — the body as
an embedded-file `data` value at `steps[i] -> bash -> script`, each
user arg at `steps[i] -> bash -> args[j]` — the same fields pass 8
validates (see the SimpleAction section of
[validation.md](validation.md)), never through the desugared script,
whose synthetic paths would name nodes the template does not contain.

The check symbol tables mirror what the session runtime binds at run
time, with everything only a session can know left `Unresolved`:

- **Task scope** (step scripts): concrete `Param.*` / `RawParam.*` /
  `Job.Name` / `Step.Name` / step-level `let` bindings; `Unresolved`
  `Session.*`, PATH `Param.*`, `Task.Param.*` / `Task.RawParam.*`,
  `Task.File.*`. Script-level `let` bindings are evaluated into the
  table (this subsumes the type check job creation has always run on
  them: a binding that fails with the real parameter values fails
  here, deterministically, rather than in every session).
- **Session scope** (job and step environments): as above minus
  `Task.*`, plus this environment's `Env.File.*` (`Unresolved`) and its
  script-level `let` bindings evaluated in. Both scopes evaluate `let`
  bindings through one shared helper that parses under the **caller's
  profile** (the same profile the checks evaluate format strings
  with), so the two builders cannot drift apart on parse profile. An
  environment `let` binding that fails to evaluate fails job creation
  (like the step-script `let` check above): the bindings only evaluate
  when the context profile enables EXPR, their expressions already
  type-checked at pass 8 with everything unresolved, so a failure here
  comes from the real parameter values and would deterministically
  recur in every session that enters the environment.

A failed placeholder `set` while building a check table also
propagates: a silently missing symbol would surface as an "undefined
variable" evaluation error, which the error policy below deliberately
skips — degrading that field's check to a no-op with no signal.

Failures are `ModelError::ModelValidation` at the same field paths
pass 8 uses, e.g.
`steps[0] -> script -> actions -> onRun -> args[0]:` /
`resolves to at least 100000 characters, exceeding the maximum of 1024.`
Violations **accumulate across the whole template** — every step's
script and environments plus the job environments — into one
collection, reported together exactly as pass 8 reports, so one
submission round-trip surfaces every violation. Every other
job-creation failure mode still aborts at the first error.

**Error policy.** Unlike pass 8, evaluation/parse errors are *not*
reported by this pass: `create_job` may deliberately run with a
different profile than the template was decoded with (see `ctx` above),
so an evaluation error here can be a context artifact rather than a
template defect — and the carried-forward strings hard-fail on the
worker anyway. The exception is a budget exceedance
(`ExpressionError::is_budget_exceeded`, which matches
`MemoryLimitExceeded` / `OperationLimitExceeded` recursively through
compound errors' `sub_errors()`): the same expression evaluates under
the same budgets at run time with strictly more symbols bound, so
exceeding the budget here means run-time resolution would too, and it
is reported. The evaluator guarantees such errors are visible: budget
exceedances propagate out of the branch-error suppression for
unresolved-test conditionals and boolean operators (see the evaluator
spec) instead of being swallowed as branch-local failures. (One
coarseness caveat: for an unresolved-test conditional the evaluator
charges both branches against the budget, while a run-time evaluation
with the test resolved charges one — a budget within a branch-cost of
the limit can fail here and pass there; callers lowering the budgets
accept that granularity.) Resolved-value constraint violations (the
table above) are always reported.

Cost note: job creation previously did not evaluate these fields, so the pass
adds work proportional to what a single worker would do anyway — done
once at submission instead of per-task-per-worker.

### convert_environment

```rust
pub fn convert_environment(env: &template::Environment) -> job::Environment
```

Converts a template environment to a resolved job environment. Takes 1 argument and is
infallible. Environment variables and script fields remain as FormatString (session-scope).

A separate `convert_environment_with_symtab` function accepts an optional `&SymbolTable`
to filter the symbol table to only symbols referenced by the environment's format strings.

### evaluate_let_bindings

```rust
pub fn evaluate_let_bindings(
    bindings: &[String],
    symtab: &SymbolTable,
    library: Option<&FunctionLibrary>,
    path_format: PathFormat,
    memory_limit: Option<usize>,
    operation_limit: Option<usize>,
) -> Result<SymbolTable, ModelError>
```

Evaluates `"name = expression"` bindings sequentially. Each binding sees the results of
all prior bindings in the same block. Returns a new symbol table with the binding results
added.

The `library` parameter is optional (pass `None` for template-scope bindings that don't
need host functions). `path_format` controls path construction behavior.
`memory_limit` / `operation_limit` bound each binding's evaluation
(`CallerLimits::max_eval_memory_bytes` / `max_eval_operations`); `None`
uses the spec-recommended defaults.

## Design Decisions

### Explicit Instantiation (vs Generic Traversal)

The Python library uses `instantiate_model()` which generically traverses Pydantic models
via metadata to find and resolve FormatString fields. The Rust crate uses explicit conversion
methods on each type instead. This is more verbose but:

- Makes template-scope vs session-scope distinction explicit and compiler-verified
- Avoids runtime reflection or trait object overhead
- Makes it clear which fields are resolved at which phase
- Allows different resolution strategies per field (e.g., host requirements resolve
  FormatStrings to f64, while step names resolve to String)

### Merged Constraint Validation

When multiple templates define the same parameter, constraints are merged (intersection for
allowedValues, most restrictive for ranges). The merged constraints are validated for
consistency — e.g., if the intersection of allowedValues is empty, or if the merged
min > merged max, that's an error. This catches conflicts that individual template
validation wouldn't find.

### Path Normalization Without Filesystem Access

`normalize_path` performs pure path normalization (resolving `.` and `..` components)
without filesystem access. This is important because:
- Templates may reference paths that don't exist yet
- The crate should be usable in environments without filesystem access
- Path mapping (for cross-platform execution) happens at session time, not job creation time
