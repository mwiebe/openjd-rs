# Validation Pipeline

The `template::validate_v2023_09` module implements a multi-pass validation pipeline that
runs after serde deserialization. It validates semantic constraints that serde can't express.
The module lives inside `template/` because validation is a template concern, and is
version-scoped to `v2023_09` because validation rules are specific to a spec revision.

## Entry Points

```rust
pub(crate) fn validate_job_template(
    jt: &JobTemplate,
    ctx: &ValidationContext,
) -> Result<(), ModelError>

pub(crate) fn validate_environment_template(
    et: &EnvironmentTemplate,
    ctx: &ValidationContext,
) -> Result<(), ModelError>
```

Both functions are crate-private — external callers use `decode_job_template` and
`decode_environment_template`, which call these internally.

Both functions compute `EffectiveLimits` and `EffectiveRules` from the context, run all
applicable passes, and return accumulated errors as `ModelError::ModelValidation`.

## Pass Architecture

The validation pipeline is passes 5–10 of the overall decode pipeline (passes 1–4 are in
the `parse` module — see [parsing.md](parsing.md)). Passes run sequentially. Each pass
receives the template and the computed limits/rules, and appends errors to a shared
`ValidationErrors` collector. All passes run regardless of earlier errors (no
short-circuiting), so users see all problems at once.

| Pass | File | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| 5 | `limits.rs` | Enforce numeric limits (name lengths, counts); FEATURE_BUNDLE_1 raises many limits |
| 6 | `structure.rs` | Structural validation (uniqueness, required fields, dependencies) |
| 7 | `feature_bundle_1.rs` | Gate FEATURE_BUNDLE_1 features (simple actions, endOfLine) |
| 8 | `format_strings.rs` | Validate format string variable references; adapts scopes and expression complexity based on EXPR |
| 9 | `task_chunking.rs` | Gate TASK_CHUNKING features (ChunkInt parameters) |
| 10 | `wrap_actions.rs` | Gate WRAP_ACTIONS features (onWrapEnvEnter, onWrapTaskRun, onWrapEnvExit) and enforce the single-wrap-layer-per-session rule (RFC 0008) |

### Environment template pipeline

`validate_environment_template` runs the same passes with job-template-only checks
omitted (there are no steps, so passes 9's ChunkInt checks and pass 6's step/dependency
checks have nothing to walk):

- **Limits + structure** — parameter-definition count/uniqueness (its own cap,
  `max_env_template_param_count`), then `validate_single_environment` for the env body.
- **Pass 7** — `validate_feature_bundle_1_environment_template`: `endOfLine` on the
  environment's embedded files requires FEATURE_BUNDLE_1.
- **Pass 8** — `validate_format_strings_environment_template`: the environment body
  (`variables`, action `command`/`args`, embedded files — all `@fmtstring[host]`) is
  validated in **session scope** exactly like an environment inside a job template.
  `Param.*`/`RawParam.*` come from the template's own `parameterDefinitions`;
  `Session.*` and `Env.File.*` are available; with EXPR, `Job.Name` is also in scope
  (the environment runs inside some job's session at runtime) but `Step.Name` is NOT
  (an environment template is not attached to a step). Action `timeout` and
  `notifyPeriodInSeconds` are plain `@fmtstring` (job-creation stage) and validate in
  **template scope** instead — no `Session.*`/`Env.File.*`. `let` bindings require
  EXPR; with EXPR they are validated and type-checked into the symbol table. Complex
  expressions (anything beyond a bare `{{Name.Path}}` reference) require EXPR in
  variables, action commands/args, and embedded-file data. Embedded-file
  `filename` is a plain string (not `@fmtstring`) — brace syntax in it is
  literal text and no format-string validation applies.
- **Pass 10** — WRAP_ACTIONS gating (see below).

## Pass 5: Limits Enforcement

Walks the template tree checking every name length, list count, and string length against
`EffectiveLimits`. Pure numeric checks with no extension branching.

Checks include:
- Job name length vs `max_job_name_len`
- Parameter count vs `max_param_count`
- Parameter name lengths vs `max_identifier_len`
- Step name lengths vs `max_step_name_len`
- Embedded file name/filename lengths
- Task parameter name lengths
- Environment name lengths vs `max_env_name_len`

## Pass 6: Structural Validation

The largest pass. Validates template structure using `EffectiveRules`. Key checks:

**Template level:**
- At least one step required
- Job name non-empty, no control characters
- Extensions list non-empty if present (enforced early in pass 4)
- Description length and control character validation

**Parameter definitions:**
- Non-empty if present
- No duplicate names (case-sensitive)
- Parameter type in `rules.allowed_job_param_types`
- Type-specific validation via `validate_definition(limits)`

**Environment uniqueness:**
- Names unique within `jobEnvironments`
- Names unique within each step's `stepEnvironments`
- A `stepEnvironments` name must not match any `jobEnvironments` name
- Different steps may reuse a `stepEnvironments` name (only one step's environments are active in a session at a time)

**Step validation:**
- No duplicate step names
- Step name non-empty, no control characters
- Must have `script` or exactly one simple action field (mutually exclusive)
- Dependencies: no self-dependency, target must exist, no duplicates
- Host requirements: amounts/attributes validation, capability name patterns,
  reserved scope checks (reserved scopes: `worker`, `job`, `step`, `task`),
  standard capability value validation. Expression-free amount `min`/`max` values must
  parse as finite numbers; validation of values containing expressions is deferred until
  job creation.

  Two deferrals behave differently, so they are worth stating separately. An
  `attributes[].anyOf` / `.allOf` element that is a format string skips the
  `<AttributeCapabilityValue>` pattern, length and standard-value checks here, and job
  creation resumes all three (see [job-creation.md](job-creation.md)). An amount `min`/`max`
  that is a format string skips the non-negative, positive and `min <= max` bound checks
  here, and job creation re-applies all three on the resolved value
  (`check_resolved_amount_bounds`). The same holds for `chunks.defaultTaskCount` and
  `chunks.targetRuntimeSeconds`: decode reads `as_i64()`, which is `None` for a format
  string, and job creation rejects a resolved value below the §3.4.1.5 minimum rather than
  clamping it.

  Only the first failing group is reported on the job-creation path, for both attributes and
  amounts, because the caller collects through `?`. Decode accumulates every violation.
- Parameter space: ≤16 task parameters, no duplicate names, type allowed,
  range validation per type, combination expression validation
- Script actions: command non-empty, length limits, `Task.File.*` references
  must match embedded file names
- Embedded files: no duplicate names, type must be `TEXT`, valid identifier names,
  data required; `filename` must be a single safe path component — non-empty, no
  path separators (`/` or `\`), no null characters, and not `.` or `..`

**Cycle detection:**
- Iterative DFS with tri-state marking (Unvisited/Started/Completed) on the step
  dependency graph

**Combination expression validation:**
- Character allowlist, balanced parentheses, tokenization
- All referenced parameters must exist and appear exactly once
- All defined parameters must appear in the expression

## Pass 7: FEATURE_BUNDLE_1 Gating

Validates or rejects features gated behind `FEATURE_BUNDLE_1`:

- **SimpleAction fields** (bash, python, cmd, powershell, node): Rejected without extension;
  mutually exclusive with `script` when enabled
- **`endOfLine` on embedded files**: Rejected without extension; must be `LF`, `CRLF`, or
  `AUTO` when enabled

## Pass 8: Format String Validation

The most complex pass. Validates that all format string references resolve to defined
variables by building scope-appropriate symbol tables.

### Symbol Table Construction

Four scope levels, each building on the previous:

1. **Param symtab** — `Param.*` and `RawParam.*` from job parameter definitions.
   PATH types excluded from `Param.*` at template scope (host-only).
   `RawParam.*` for PATH types is STRING.

2. **Template scope** — For job name, host requirements, parameter space ranges.
   Uses param symtab without PATH parameters.

3. **Session scope** — For environment scripts/variables. Adds `Session.WorkingDirectory`,
   `Session.HasPathMappingRules`, `Session.PathMappingRulesFile`, `Env.File.*`.
   With EXPR: adds `Job.Name` in all environments and `Step.Name` in step
   environments only. Used both for environments inside a job template and for
   standalone environment templates (which never get `Step.Name`).

Scope selection follows the spec's `@fmtstring` stage annotations, not the
container: `timeout` and `notifyPeriodInSeconds` are plain `@fmtstring`
(resolved at job creation, before any session exists), so they validate in
template scope — with `Job.Name`/`Step.Name`/step `let` bindings where
applicable, but no `Session.*`, no `Env.File.*`, no `Task.*`, and the
template function library (no `apply_path_mapping`) — even though they sit
on actions whose `command`/`args` are `@fmtstring[host]` and validate in
session/task scope.

4. **Task scope** — For step scripts. Adds `Task.Param.*`, `Task.RawParam.*`,
   `Task.File.*`. With EXPR: adds `Job.Name`, `Step.Name`, `Env.File.*` from
   step and job environments.

### Let Binding Validation

Let bindings are validated with these rules:
- Non-empty if present, ≤50 bindings
- Each binding has `=` separator
- Name: non-empty, starts with lowercase/underscore, alphanumeric+underscore
- No duplicate names
- No shadowing of enclosing scope names
- No self-references (checked via regex on non-string-literal portions)
- Expression parsed and type-checked; result type added to symtab for subsequent bindings
- On error, the binding is added as `unresolved(ANY)` to the symbol table to prevent
  cascading type errors in subsequent bindings that reference it. (The `unresolved(ANY)`
  type is from the `openjd-expr` type system — see `specs/expr/type-system.md`.)

### Function Libraries

Two libraries control available functions in expressions:
- **`template_lib`** — Template-scope expressions. Built from a profile with
  `HostContext::None` (no host functions registered at all).
- **`host_lib`** — Task/session-scope expressions. Built from a profile with
  `HostContext::Unresolved` so `apply_path_mapping` type-checks against its
  signature (a stub returning `Unresolved(path)`) without real rules being
  available at validation time.

Both libraries are obtained from
`openjd_expr::FunctionLibrary::for_profile(&profile)`. The model's
`SpecificationProfile::to_expr_profile(host_context)` helper produces the
right `ExprProfile` from a model profile.

### Spec-Mandated Resolved-Value Constraints

Pass 8 uses the values that static evaluation can resolve: for fields
whose spec constraints apply to the *resolved* value — "after the format
string has been resolved" in the spec's wording — the
`openjd_expr::StaticResolution` returned by `validate_expressions` is
checked against a per-field `ResolvedConstraint`. This makes template
validation the earliest of the spec's three processing stages (Template
Schemas §7.4: template validation, job creation, task execution on the
worker host) to catch a violation that is already knowable, instead of
deferring it to job submission or the worker. Two stages of checking:

1. **Lower bound** — `min_resolved_string_len` holds for every possible
   run-time resolution (unresolved segments contribute 0), so a bound
   past the field's limit is a certain violation and fails `check`
   without knowing the unresolved parts.
2. **Full value check** — when `resolved_value` is present the field is
   fully static, and the same check job creation or the worker would run
   on the resolved value runs here, with matching error messages.

| Field | Target type | Bound | Fully-static check |
|---|---|---|---|
| job `name` (Template Schemas §1.1.1) | `string` | ≤ `max_job_name_len` (128, 512 with FB1) | non-empty (§1.1.1 min 1); no Cc control characters |
| attribute `anyOf`/`allOf` values (Template Schemas §3.3.2.2) | `string? \| list[string]` | when certainly a string: ≤ 100; for a standard capability, ≤ longest allowed value | `validate_attribute_capability_value` (charset / allowed set) on the value, or on each element when a list flattens; `null` skips the element |
| task param STRING/PATH range elements (Template Schemas §3.4.2) | `string? \| list[string]` | when certainly a string: ≤ 1024 | ≤ 1024 chars per element (a list flattens); PATH elements additionally must be non-empty (see below); `null` skips the element |
| environment variable values (Template Schemas §4.4.2) | `string` | ≤ `max_env_var_value_len` (2048) | (length is the whole constraint) |
| action `timeout` (FB1 `<posintstring>`, Template Schemas §5) | `int?` | soft cap: 100 chars | coerced integer > 0; `null` = unset |
| `notifyPeriodInSeconds` (Template Schemas §5.3.2, FB1) | `int?` | soft cap: 100 chars | coerced integer > 0, ≤ 600; `null` = unset |
| cancelation `mode` (FB1 deferred, Template Schemas §5.3) | `string?` | ≤ 21 chars (longest valid value) | `TERMINATE` / `NOTIFY_THEN_TERMINATE`; `null` = cancelation unset |
| chunks `defaultTaskCount` (TASK_CHUNKING, Template Schemas §3.4.1.5) | `int` | soft cap: 100 chars | coerced integer ≥ 1 |
| chunks `targetRuntimeSeconds` (TASK_CHUNKING, Template Schemas §3.4.1.5) | `int?` | soft cap: 100 chars | coerced integer ≥ 0; `null` = unset |
| amount `min` / `max` (FB1 float strings, Template Schemas §3.3.1) | `float?` | soft cap: 100 chars | finite float, ≥ 0 / > 0; `null` = unset |
| action `command` (Template Schemas §5.1) — **opt-in** `CallerLimits::max_resolved_arg_len` | none (resolution is `resolve_string_with`) | ≤ cap, unconditionally (everything renders inline into one string) | (length is the whole constraint) |
| action `args[*]` (Template Schemas §5.2) — **opt-in** `CallerLimits::max_resolved_arg_len` | none (resolution is `resolve_with` with no target) | when certainly a string: ≤ cap | ≤ cap per final argv entry (a list flattens into one entry per element; `null` skips) |
| embedded file `data` (Template Schemas §6.1.2) — **opt-in** `CallerLimits::max_resolved_data_len` | none (resolution is `resolve_string_with`) | ≤ cap, unconditionally | (length is the whole constraint) |

The three opt-in rows are **caller policy, not spec constraints**: §5.1,
§5.2 and §6.1.2 deliberately set no maximum (the OS imposes its own on
process arguments), so the caps default to `None` and impose nothing.
When a caller sets one, the same three-stage early-failure model applies
as for the spec-mandated rows. The `openjd` CLI sets
`max_resolved_arg_len` to the host OS maximum by default (see
`specs/cli/`).

Separately from per-field constraints, pass 8 evaluates every
format-string expression under the caller's **evaluation budgets**
(`CallerLimits::max_eval_memory_bytes` / `max_eval_operations`, defaults:
the Expression Language spec's 100 MB / 10 M). These bound each segment's
evaluation identically at validation, job creation, and run time — the
spec's own lever against expression blowups like `'A' * 10000000` — so a
lowered budget fails at this gate first, as an ordinary
`Failed to parse interpolation expression` error at the field path.

Numeric fields have no exact length maximum — leading zeros are legal and
surrounding whitespace is tolerated in string forms — so they use a soft
100-character cap (`MAX_RESOLVED_NUMERIC_LEN`): no reasonable numeric
value is longer, and an i64 needs at most 20 characters.

#### Target types: the general rule

Expression Language **§1.3.2 "Evaluation Within Template Schemas"** gives
every format-string field a target type for its whole-field expressions,
derived from the schema context:

- a required field of type `T` targets `T`;
- an optional field targets `T?` — a `null` result means "field omitted";
- a list item targets `T? | list[T]` — `null` skips the item, a list
  flattens inline (the spec's worked example is `args`; range elements
  and attribute values are list items under the same rule);
- a format string with surrounding text always concatenates to a string,
  with each expression evaluated unconstrained.

Every constrained field follows the rule (for
`timeout`/`notifyPeriodInSeconds`/`mode` the Template Schemas doc also
mandates the target explicitly), and **the later processing stages
resolve each field with the same target validation checks it with** —
job name and range elements in `create_job`, attribute values and amounts
in `instantiate`, environment variable values and the action numeric
fields in `openjd-sessions`. A field's validation-time target must
always equal its resolution-time target, or validation rejects values
resolution accepts (or vice versa).

Consequences of the target types worth naming:

- For the scalar `string` fields, there is no `list[T] → string` or
  `null → string` conversion, so a whole-field list or `null` is an
  error. The job name additionally may not resolve to an empty string
  (§1.1.1 minimum length 1; checked statically here, and on the resolved
  value at job creation). Environment variable values have **no**
  minimum — §4.4.2's minimum length is 0 characters, so an empty
  resolution is legal. Null (and lists) *inside* surrounding text remain
  ordinary interpolation and render their display form.
- For the list-item fields (range elements, attribute values), a
  whole-field `null` skips the element and a list flattens inline —
  `range: ["first", "{{ RawParam.Paths }}", "last"]` yields one element
  per path between the literals. The per-element constraints apply to
  each flattened element. Because null-skips can empty a list whose
  non-emptiness was checked on field presence at decode, job creation
  re-checks after resolution ("has no elements after resolution"). A
  range that is entirely one expression can also use the whole-field
  `<ListExpressionString>` form (Expression Language §1.3.12 "Task
  Parameter Range Field Extensions").
- The length bound for list-item fields only applies when the resolution
  is certainly a string (`StaticResolution::resolved_type` is `string`):
  a list-valued resolution distributes its characters across elements,
  so the display-form length says nothing about any single element.
- **Empty range elements are rejected for PATH only.** §3.4.2 sets a
  minimum length of 1 on `<TaskParameterStringValue>` (which STRING and
  PATH ranges share), but the reference implementation enforces it only
  for PATH — its rationale being that an empty string is not a valid
  path on any OS — and accepts empty STRING elements end to end
  (`TaskParameterStringValueAsJob` is explicitly `min_length=0`). We
  match that for compatibility. PATH elements are rejected at every
  stage where they become knowable: a literal `""` at raw-text
  validation (structure), a static resolution here, and an interpolated
  value at job creation (`resolve_string_range`). STRING elements are
  never rejected for emptiness.

One further deliberate exclusion: **literals**. `validate_fs` skips
literal format strings; the raw-text passes (structure/limits) already
check those, and for a literal the raw text and resolved value coincide.

## Pass 9: TASK_CHUNKING Gating

Validates or rejects features gated behind `TASK_CHUNKING`:

- `ChunkInt` task parameters rejected without extension
- With extension: `defaultTaskCount` ≥ 1, `targetRuntimeSeconds` ≥ 0
- Only one `ChunkInt` parameter per step
- `ChunkInt` parameter must not appear inside parentheses in the combination expression
  (must not be in an associative combination)

## Pass 10: WRAP_ACTIONS Gating

Validates or rejects features gated behind `WRAP_ACTIONS` (RFC 0008):

- **Wrap hooks** (`onWrapEnvEnter`, `onWrapTaskRun`, `onWrapEnvExit`): Rejected on any
  environment when the extension is not declared.
- **EXPR prerequisite**: `WRAP_ACTIONS` requires `EXPR` to also be declared (the wrap
  mechanism forwards inner-action bytes through the EXPR function library). Declaring
  `WRAP_ACTIONS` without `EXPR` is an error.
- **All-or-nothing rule**: an environment that defines any one wrap hook must define all
  three. Defining a partial set is an error.
- **Single-wrap-layer rule**: at most one environment reachable in a session may define
  wrap hooks. A session's environment stack is the job's `jobEnvironments` plus exactly
  one step's `stepEnvironments`, so this is enforced per step: for every step, the count
  of wrap-defining envs in `jobEnvironments` plus that step's `stepEnvironments` must be
  ≤ 1. Multiple wrap envs in `jobEnvironments` alone are reported once at the
  `jobEnvironments` path (reachable from every session); a step that adds its own wrap env
  on top is reported at that step's `stepEnvironments` path.

The single-layer rule runs only in the job-template path. An environment template defines
one environment, so the rule is trivially satisfied for an isolated env template; if
separately-validated env templates are composed into a session at assembly time
(worker-side), the cross-layer constraint must be enforced there.
