# Windows Cross-User Helper Subprocess

Port the existing POSIX cross-user helper to Windows, reusing the same binary
and JSON protocol.

## Background

On POSIX, cross-user subprocess execution uses a persistent helper process
launched via `sudo -u <user> -i <helper_path>`. The helper communicates over
newline-delimited JSON on stdin/stdout. This avoids paying the ~1s sudo login
cost per action and provides reliable cancel via `killpg`.

On Windows, cross-user execution currently uses `CreateProcessAsUserW` /
`CreateProcessWithLogonW` directly from the session code. This works for
launching processes, but **cancellation is broken** because:

1. `CTRL_BREAK_EVENT` requires `AttachConsole` which doesn't work from
   Session 0 (Windows services) or across user boundaries
2. The Python openjd-sessions works around this by spawning a separate
   Python script (`_signal_win_subprocess.py`) to send the signal from
   the target user's context

The fix: use the same persistent helper architecture as POSIX. The helper
runs as the target user, so console APIs and process termination work
correctly from within the right user/session context.

## Current POSIX Architecture

```
Session (agent user)          Helper (job user, via sudo)
    |                              |
    |-- {"token":..., "command":..., "args":..., "env":..., "cwd":...} -->
    |                              |-- spawns child process
    |                              |   (process group 0)
    |<-- {"pid": 1234} -----------|
    |<-- {"out": "line..."} ------|   (stdout lines)
    |                              |
    |-- {"token":..., "cancel":"NOTIFY_THEN_TERMINATE","notifyPeriodInSeconds":5} -->|-- killpg(child, SIGTERM)
    |                              |   (grace period, then SIGKILL if still alive)
    |                              |
    |<-- {"exited": 0} ----------|
    |                              |
    |-- {"token":..., "shutdown":true} -->|-- exits
```

The `token` value is a random 22-character ASCII string (128 bits of
entropy, drawn from a 64-char URL-safe alphabet via the OS CSPRNG) passed
to the helper once on the command line as `--auth-token <TOKEN>` and
required on every subsequent request. See
[Authentication Token](sessions/embedded-cross-user-helper.md#authentication-token)
for the full rationale.

### Key files

- `cross_user_helper.rs` — session-side: spawns helper, sends commands,
  reads responses via `run_via_helper()`
- `helper/src/main.rs` — helper binary: reads commands, dispatches to runner
- `helper/src/runner.rs` — runs child process, multiplexes stdin cancel +
  child stdout via `poll()`
- `helper/src/protocol.rs` — shared JSON types (Command, Response)

## What Changes for Windows

### Protocol — platform-agnostic cancel

The cancel protocol uses spec-aligned names from the OpenJD
`cancelationMethod` schema, not platform-specific signal names:

| Cancel method | Wire format |
|---------------|-------------|
| Graceful (notify then kill) | `{"cancel": "NOTIFY_THEN_TERMINATE", "notifyPeriodInSeconds": <secs>}` |
| Immediate kill | `{"cancel": "TERMINATE"}` |

The helper maps these to the appropriate OS primitives internally:
- `NOTIFY_THEN_TERMINATE` → SIGTERM on POSIX, CTRL_BREAK on Windows;
  escalates to SIGKILL / kill_process_tree after the notify period.
- `TERMINATE` → SIGKILL on POSIX, kill_process_tree on Windows.

### Helper binary (`helper/src/runner.rs`) — add `#[cfg(windows)]`

The POSIX runner uses `poll()` on raw fds to multiplex stdin and child stdout.
Windows doesn't have `poll()` on pipe handles. The Windows runner uses two
threads instead:

```
                    Helper process (job-user)
                    ┌─────────────────────────────┐
  stdin ──────────> │  Main thread                │
  (cancel cmds)     │  - reads stdin lines        │
                    │  - on cancel: signal child  │
                    │                             │
                    │  Stdout thread              │
                    │  - reads child stdout       │ ──> stdout
                    │  - sends {"out":...} lines  │     (to session)
                    │                             │
                    │  Child process (job-user)   │
                    │  - CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP │
                    └─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Child spawning**: Use `std::process::Command` with `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`.
The helper already runs as the target user, so no `CreateProcessAsUserW` needed
inside the helper.

**Cancel handling**:
- `{"cancel": "NOTIFY_THEN_TERMINATE", "notifyPeriodInSeconds": <secs>}` →
  `GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent(CTRL_BREAK_EVENT, child_pid)`. If the child doesn't
  exit within the notify period, escalates to `kill_process_tree(child_pid)`.
  Works because the helper is in the same user/session as the child.
- `{"cancel": "TERMINATE"}` → `kill_process_tree(child_pid)` using
  `TerminateProcess` on each process in the tree.

**I/O multiplexing**: Two threads sharing a channel:
- Thread 1 (main): reads stdin for cancel commands, signals child on cancel
- Thread 2: reads child stdout line-by-line, sends `{"out":...}` responses
- Main thread joins stdout thread after child exits, then sends `{"exited":...}`

### Helper launch (`cross_user_helper.rs`) — add `#[cfg(windows)]` spawn

Replace `sudo -u <user> -i <helper_path>` with:

```rust
#[cfg(windows)]
pub fn spawn(
    helper_path: &Path,
    user: &dyn SessionUser,
) -> Result<(Self, /* cancel_writer */), SessionError> {
    let wu = user.as_any().downcast_ref::<WindowsSessionUser>().unwrap();
    let spawned = win32::spawn_as_user(
        &[helper_path.to_string_lossy().to_string()],
        &HashMap::new(),  // env
        None,             // working_dir
        wu.password(),
        wu.user(),
        wu.logon_token(),
    )?;
    // spawned.process_handle, spawned.stdout_read, spawned.pid
    // Need to also create a stdin pipe for sending commands
    ...
}
```

**Stdin pipe**: `win32::spawn_as_user` currently only creates a stdout pipe.
It needs to be extended to also create an stdin pipe (or the helper launch
code creates the pipes and passes them to `CreateProcessAsUserW`).

**Cancel writer dup**: Use `DuplicateHandle` instead of `nix::unistd::dup`
to create a second handle to the stdin pipe for sending cancel commands.

### Session integration (`subprocess.rs`) — wire up helper path

The `run_subprocess` function currently has two Windows paths:
1. Same-user: `tokio::process::Command` (works fine)
2. Cross-user: `win32::spawn_as_user` + in-process cancel (broken)

Change path 2 to use the helper via `run_via_helper()`, matching POSIX.
The `run_via_helper` function in `cross_user_helper.rs` is already
platform-agnostic — it just sends JSON and reads JSON.

### `win32::spawn_as_user` — add stdin pipe support

Currently `spawn_as_user` creates a stdout pipe but no stdin pipe. For the
helper, we need bidirectional communication. Add an optional stdin pipe:

```rust
pub struct SpawnedProcess {
    pub process_handle: HANDLE,
    pub pid: u32,
    pub stdout_read: OwnedHandle,
    pub stdin_write: Option<OwnedHandle>,  // NEW
}
```

The stdin pipe is created the same way as stdout (via `CreatePipe` with
inheritable read end), and the read end is passed as `hStdInput` in
`STARTUPINFOW`.

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Extend `win32::spawn_as_user` with stdin pipe ✅

Added `spawn_as_user_with_stdin` and `create_stdin_pipe`. The read end goes
to the child's `hStdInput`, the write end is returned in
`SpawnedProcess.stdin_write`.

### Step 2: Add `#[cfg(windows)]` runner in `helper/src/runner_win.rs` ✅

Implemented `run_command` for Windows using two threads for I/O multiplexing.
Handle cancel commands by calling `GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent` or
`kill_process_tree`. Three integration tests pass (echo, cancel, nonexistent).

### Step 3: Add `#[cfg(windows)]` spawn in `cross_user_helper.rs` ✅

Added `CrossUserHelperWin` struct that launches the helper via
`spawn_as_user_with_stdin`. Uses `DuplicateHandle` to create the cancel
writer (analogous to POSIX `dup()`). Extracted `HelperIO` trait so
`run_via_helper` works with both POSIX and Windows helper types.

### Step 4: Wire up in `session.rs` and runner modules ✅

Removed all `#[cfg(unix)]` guards on helper usage. The session now spawns
`CrossUserHelperWin` on Windows (via `helper_binary::write_helper` +
`CrossUserHelperWin::spawn`), passes it to runners, and routes all
cross-user subprocess execution through `run_via_helper`.

Updated `build.rs` to compile the helper binary on Windows too, using
`include_bytes!` just like POSIX.

### Step 5: Remove in-process `send_ctrl_break` for cross-user

The in-process `AttachConsole` + `GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent` code in
`subprocess.rs` is no longer needed for cross-user. It remains as a
fallback for same-user processes (where it works fine). The session's
`cancel_action` now sends platform-agnostic cancel commands
(`NOTIFY_THEN_TERMINATE` or `TERMINATE`) through the helper's stdin pipe.
The helper maps these to the appropriate OS primitives internally.

### Step 6: Protect the Windows helper binary from the session user ✅

The session working directory's DACL on Windows grants the session user
Modify so that action scripts can write files into it. Without additional
protection, the `.helpers-<uuid>` subdirectory and the helper binary
inside would inherit that Modify ACE — and the session user could
overwrite the helper binary to escalate into the process user context
the next time the session starts a new action.

`helper_binary::create_helpers_dir` and `helper_binary::write_helper`
both call `win32_permissions::set_permissions_protected` on Windows
(cross-user only). This:

- Replaces the explicit DACL with
  `[process user → Full Control, session user → Read & Execute]`.
- Sets `PROTECTED_DACL_SECURITY_INFORMATION` on the object, severing
  inheritance from the parent session working directory.

The session user can still traverse the directory and execute the
helper binary (the spawn is done by the process user, so the binary
only needs to be loadable by the session user's logon token), but
cannot write, delete, or replace it.

The binary's own DACL is set separately from the directory's DACL as
defense-in-depth — if the directory's DACL is ever weakened, the
binary's protected DACL still enforces read-only for the session user.

## Testing

- Unit test: `test_cancel_terminate_on_windows` (already exists, same-user)
- Integration test: helper protocol round-trip (spawn helper, send command,
  read output, send cancel, verify exit)
- E2E: the existing worker agent cancellation tests that currently fail
- DACL tests in `tests/test_cross_user_windows.rs`:
  - `test_cross_user_helpers_dir_dacl_protects_from_session_user`
  - `test_cross_user_helper_binary_dacl_protects_from_session_user`
  - `test_cross_user_session_user_cannot_overwrite_helper_binary`
    (functional: the session user's attempt to write to the helper
    binary must fail, and the binary on disk must match the embedded
    size)
