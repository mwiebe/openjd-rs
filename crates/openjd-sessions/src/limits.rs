//! Of the spec's three processing stages (Template Schemas §7.4:
//! template validation, job creation, task execution on the worker
//! host), task execution is the enforcement boundary: a worker can

//! validation or job creation, so the runtime must enforce these
//! limits on the final resolved values regardless of what earlier
