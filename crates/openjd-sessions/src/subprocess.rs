///
/// On top of the cycle guard this mirrors psutil's `Process.children()`

/// parent, so an edge (child, ppid) is accepted only when `ppid` is an

/// exited) has a child older than the recorded parent and always fails the
/// check. We fail closed on stale edges (a child older than its recorded
/// parent, the mark of a reused parent PID). A child whose creation time is
/// unreadable is NOT skipped: it is recorded as a traversable node carrying
/// the parent's creation time as its bound (see the later paragraph), so a
/// live subtree under a dead intermediate is still reached. If the ROOT's
/// creation time is unreadable we return an empty `Vec` ONLY when no
/// schedule-time identity is pinned; with `Some(exp)` the walk is seeded from
/// that pinned identity and proceeds.
///
/// Because `FILETIME` creation times are wall-clock rather than monotonic,
/// this invariant is only exact under a forward-moving clock. An NTP
/// step-back or manual clock change between a parent's and its child's
/// creation can make a TRUE child's recorded creation time earlier than its
/// parent's, failing the `>=` edge check and pruning that child's whole
/// subtree. The failure mode is a leaked (skipped) descendant, never
/// terminating an unrelated process, so this stays on the safe under-kill
/// side.
///
/// `snapshot_time` closes a second PID-reuse direction: the one where a
/// genuine edge (child, parent) is captured in the snapshot, the child then
/// exits, and its PID is reused by an unrelated process U before this function
/// reads the child's creation time. U's creation time is newer than the
/// parent's, so the `>=` edge check passes and U would be recorded as a
/// validated node. Because every process the snapshot lists was created before
/// the enumeration walk finished (the stamp is captured after the walk), we
/// reject any DESCENDANT candidate whose freshly read creation time is greater
/// than `snapshot_time`. The stamp and process creation times share the same
/// wall-clock base (FILETIME ticks since 1601 UTC), so the comparison is exact.
///
/// The root is exempt from the `snapshot_time` bound in every arm. The root's
/// identity is never established by fossil-edge attribution (the reuse the
/// stamp guards): it is either pinned by a live `Child` handle (the immediate
/// `send_terminate` path, `expected_root_ct = None`), matched against a
/// schedule-time identity (`Some(exp)` with `read == exp`), or seeded from that
/// pinned identity when the root has already exited (`Some(exp)` with `None`).
/// A stamp comparison on the root could therefore never catch a reused PID; it
/// could only false-positive under a backward wall-clock adjustment (an NTP
/// step-back or a VM resume, where the root's FILETIME creation was recorded
/// before the step and the stamp read after it), return empty, and turn a
/// legitimate cancel into a complete no-op — nothing killed, the session left
/// waiting on a live tree. Accepted degradation: under such a backward step the
/// root is still killed, but descendants whose recorded creation times exceed
/// the post-step stamp may be skipped. That is an under-kill (a leaked
/// descendant), which stays on the safe side.
///
/// `expected_root_ct` pins the root's identity to a value established before
/// this call (a schedule-time read from the delayed-terminate path). When
/// `Some(exp)`:
/// - a fresh root read of `Some(rc)` must equal `exp`, otherwise this returns
///   empty (fail closed) — closing the reuse window between an earlier identity
///   read and this walk;
/// - a fresh root read of `None` (the root exited during the grace period, its
///   PID currently unassigned) SEEDS the walk with `ValidatedProcess { pid:
///   root_pid, creation_time: exp }` and proceeds. This is the common
///   delayed-path case, whose whole purpose is reaping orphaned grandchildren:
///   `kill_process_checked` no-ops on the dead root, but its orphaned
///   descendants are still enumerated and validated against `>= exp` and
///   `<= snapshot_time`.
///
/// The recorded root node then carries `exp`, the pinned identity, not any
/// re-read value. When `expected_root_ct` is `None`, an unreadable fresh root
/// read returns empty (fail closed) and a readable one is accepted as-is (the
/// live `Child` handle already pins the PID; see the root-exemption note
/// above).
///
/// A child whose creation time is unreadable under an already-validated parent
/// is kept TRAVERSABLE rather than pruned: it is recorded carrying the parent's
/// creation time (a sound lower bound for ITS children) so that a live subtree
/// under a dead intermediate (cmd -> sh -> renderer, sh exits first) is still
/// reached. `kill_process_checked` cannot open the dead PID, so nothing is
/// terminated for the node itself; only its readable, validated descendants
/// are. Stale (`< parent`) and post-snapshot (`> snapshot_time`) rejections
/// still apply to READABLE children exactly as before.
///
/// Residual: seeding a dead root and traversing dead intermediates reopens a
/// bounded window. A freed PID's fossil edges (recorded `th32ParentProcessID`
/// values) can include children of an INTERIM holder of that PID whose creation
/// times happen to land in `[exp, snapshot_time]`; those pass validation and
/// may be terminated. The window is bounded and no worse than the
/// pre-validation walk, and is structurally eliminated only by the Job Object
/// rework (issue #347).
///
/// Separate residual (distinct from the dead-root/interim-holder case above):
/// an unreadable-but-ALIVE fossil child. If a recorded `th32ParentProcessID`
/// was freed and reassigned to OUR root, an access-denied process carrying

/// only applies to READABLE children) and is recorded as a traversable node
/// carrying the parent's bound, so its own live children can fall inside
