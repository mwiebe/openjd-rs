//! Expression profile: the tuple of (revision, extensions, host context)
//! that governs which functions, operators, and types are available for a
//! given evaluation.
//!
//! A profile is passed to
//! [`FunctionLibrary::for_profile`](crate::FunctionLibrary::for_profile) to
//! obtain a library that matches the requested revision, extensions, and
//! host context. Libraries are cached per *rules-independent* profile key,
//! so callers that construct many libraries with the same spec shape and
//! different path-mapping rules pay only the host-context registration
//! cost per call.
//!
//! The three axes modelled here correspond to the axes identified in the
//! forward-compatibility evaluation report:
//!
//! - **Axis A — revision**: which base functions and operators exist
//!   (see [`ExprRevision`]).
//! - **Axis B — extensions**: which add-on functions exist
//!   (see [`ExprExtension`]).
//! - **Axis C — host state**: whether host-context implementations are
//!   real, stubbed, or absent (see [`HostContext`]).
//!
//! Axis D (scope-specific symbol availability) is handled by the caller
//! building an appropriate [`SymbolTable`](crate::SymbolTable) — it is
//! orthogonal to the profile.
